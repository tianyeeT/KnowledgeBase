The problem was, in some cases the app and the extension would hamper each other’s work. Some websites would stop being protected by the desktop program and were backed up only by the extension which has less possibilities.

"},{"title":"Filters​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-browser-extension/overview/#filters","content":"In essence, filter lists are sets of rules written in a special language. Your ad blocker interpretes the rules and implements them. As a result, you stop seeing ads on your webpages.  All filters are grouped according to their role. For example, there are categories for ad-blocking filters, privacy protection filters, social media-related filters, etc. You can enable either individual filters or the entire group at once.  Custom filters​ While the features of other filter groups are more or less predictable, there is a group called Custom that may raise additional questions.  In this tab, you can add filters that are not present in the extension by default. There are plenty of publicly available filters on the Internet. Moreover, you can create and add your own filters. In fact, you can build any set of filters and customize ad blocking the way you like.

You may use different browsers at the same time, the app will filter ads and online threats in all of them equally well. The second difference is that the possibilities of extension-based ad blockers are strictly limited by browser guidelines. The browser extensions have to conform to the policies of the browsers, where ad blocking might be restricted. Thus, some types of filtering rules are not supported by the extensions. The functionality of the desktop apps is not limited, so they have a better filtering quality. Whereas AdGuard Browser Extension is free and easy to install, and has filters to block ads and fight online threats, the full-fledged apps are more powerful and have a list of advanced features. See all the differences in the comparative table below.  1 – within browser restrictions and only in the browser where it is installed; 2 – the extension is unable to detect requests from other extensions. If a malicious or tracking extension sends a request to its server to show you ads or track your activity, AdGuard Browser Extension will not be able to block that request; 3 – not all types of ads and threats can be blocked by browser extensions due to certain browser limitations. Some elements may get to the page and slow down the loading process. Besides, unlike browser-based ad blockers, the AdGuard app blocks ads before they are loaded to the browser. This saves traffic and speeds up page loading.

To protect your entire device, download the AdGuard app AdGuard has two Android apps: AdGuard for Android and AdGuard Content Blocker. AdGuard for Android has a much wider range of functionality: it blocks ads, trackers, and annoyances in browsers and apps, uses filters as well as domain-level ad blocking, and supports user rules. AdGuard Content Blocker has a limited functionality. Full-fledged ad blockers can’t be introduced to Google Play due to the policy of the store. Google Play has banned &quot;apps that block or interfere with another app displaying ads&quot;. Thus, AdGuard for Android can be downloaded on AdGuard's official website only. As an alternative, Google offers to developers the Content blocking API. The API has strict limitations and is currently supported by two browsers: Yandex Browser and Samsung Internet browser. Many complex filtering rules supported in other AdGuard products don't work with this API. AdGuard Content Blocker was designed to fit the Google Play policy framework. Compared to other AdGuard products, AdGuard Content Blocker has less ad blocking capabilities: AdGuard Content Blocker works only in browsers that support the content blocking technology. Currently, there are two: Yandex Browser and Samsung Internet browser.Within the existing technology, the functionality of AdGuard Content Blocker is limited: for example it cannot block ads and trackers in apps or other browsers, has no filtering log and doesn't support filtering at the domain level. However, AdGuard Content Blocker has 35 filters that allow you to block ads, trackers, and annoyances in two supported browsers. You can also customize ad blocking by selecting appropriate language-specific filters or adding user rules. AdGuard Content Blocker is a free open-source software.

The mechanism of filtering ads is described here.  The ad-blocking feature is pretty obvious in its concept, but there are some points worthy of a separate mention. Most importantly, AdGuard works as a universal filter sifting through your apps traffic and deciding what to do with this or that web request. The whole process is managed by filters — lists of special rules. The program has a default and constantly updated set of filters but you can also add your own filtering rules and filters to this set. Most mobile ad blockers for Android use this principle, but what is pretty much the whole app in their case is only one of the many features for AdGuard.

"},{"title":"Filtrado HTTPS​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-android/overview/#https-filtering","content":"Nowadays almost all websites work via HTTPS, the web protocol where the last S letter stands for &quot;secure&quot;. It happened so that most advertisers use this protocol as well, this is why HTTPS filtering is really crucial for a modern ad blocker.  To be able to filter HTTPS traffic, AdGuard needs to install a certificate into your device's user storage. On older versions of Android OS this was done automatically during the onboarding process or later via AdGuard settings, and it only required a couple of taps. On Android 11 and later automatic certificate installation is no longer available. Now you need to install the certificate manually. Here is the installation instruction: Go to the app's main screen and tap Turn on next to the HTTPS filtering is off message (it will be highlighted in orange if the AdGuard certificate is not installed yet). A new screen will appear, tap Next, Next and Save it now when prompted to download the AdGuard certificate. After the certificate is downloaded, you will see a new screen. Tap Open security settings. This will bring up system settings. Scroll down to Advanced, open it and then tap Encryption &amp; credentials (these settings may be called variously on different devices — the main thing is to choose advanced security settings). Tap Install certificate and then CA certificate. A warning message will appear. Read through it and tap Install anyway to proceed. Select the recently downloaded AdGuard certificate. A CA certificate installed toast message should show up. The AdGuard certificate is successfully installed and HTTPS filtering is working now! nota If you update from Android 10 to Android 11, there's a chance that the already installed certificate will still be accepted. Otherwise, the HTTPS filtering is off warning will appear on the main screen, highlighted in orange. So you'll need to go through the same process of reinstalling the certificate manually. In case you have problems with the certificate installation, read this article or contact our support team at support@adguard.com. nota We want to emphasize that AdGuard Ad Blocker will function without HTTPS filtering. However, it won't be able to properly filter ads on sites that use the HTTPS protocol (most of sites do that). So if you want to use the full functionality of the app and get the best ad filtering quality and processing speed, we strongly recommend you to activate HTTPS filtering.

A bit of a theory refresher: DNS stands for &quot;Domain name system&quot;, and its purpose is to translate domain names into something browsers can understand, i.e. IP addresses. So, each time you go to a website, your browser sends a DNS request to a server, usually determined by your ISP. That server either redirects the request to another (upstream) server or replies with an IP address. If you use a special DNS server instead of a default one, it can send unsafe and potentially dangerous requests to the &quot;void&quot;. Thus, the responses with the IP addresses won't be received and &quot;bad requests&quot; will be nipped in the bud. DNS filtering has its own separate tab within the AdGuard for Android app home screen. Here you can choose which type of DNS you wish to use (it can be either regular DNS or high-security DNS — we will get to that later on) as well as enable DNS-level blocking. "},{"title":"DNS blocking​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-android/overview/#dns-blocking","content":"DNS blocking is a standalone feature that complements AdGuard protection suite.  There are two methods of DNS blocking: Some DNS servers can block DNS requests to potentially harmful domains.There is built-in DNS filtering that works right on your device and can block DNS requests, in addition to what's blocked by the selected DNS server. How exactly does DNS filtering work? It has a special DNS filter which contains a large list of ad and tracker domains, which it uses in conjunction with User rules to recognize 'bad' requests. Every request is checked against this filter, and if there's a hit, instead of forwarding it to the DNS server, it is being rerouted to a 'blackhole'. The simplicity of this approach is both a benefit and a disadvantage. The main advantage of this approach is that it's both battery life friendly and traffic-saving. Once a domain is blocked, it won't be requested again within an hour. The disadvantage would be the &quot;roughness&quot; of this method: specific URLs can't be blocked, only whole domains. Sometimes the only way to block ads by DNS is to add a rule that will break something at the same time. In this case, we just don't add this rule and the ad remains unblocked — because the alternative where the website does not work at all is even worse. "},{"title":"DNS servers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-android/overview/#dns-servers","content":"But AdGuard for Android &quot;DNS package&quot; does not end just there. One of the useful perks is an option to select absolutely any DNS server to use. At your service is a list consisting of dozens of servers to choose from, from our own AdGuard DNS servers to other popular providers like Google DNS, Cloudflare and others. On top of that, if your favorite server is not in the default list, you still can enter its address manually and use it anyway. See the comprehensive list of popular DNS providers — you can find many DNS servers there and any to AdGuard with a tap of a finger. There are several reasons to use a custom DNS server instead of one offered by your ISP by default. Some servers are faster, some provide ad blocking or parental control solutions, some enhance your privacy etc. But DNS servers not only vary by function. Besides, they can also differ by supported protocol types. There are three main types of protocols that DNS servers work over: HTTPS, TLS, and QUIC. Correspondingly, there are DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ). While the first two are standard protocols, the third (DoQ) is experimental, yet the most outstanding one. We'll describe it later. Choosing a DNS server from a trusted provider is essential to protect DNS traffic. When user's DNS traffic is safe, their privacy and security are increased, and it's easier to prevent eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data via man-in-the-middle attacks (MITMs).

You can set up AdGuard to route all your device's traffic through any proxy — and you'll be able to configure the whole thing right inside the app. And here is an instruction on how to set up a proxy. consejo Some popular VPN providers offer an alternative way to use their service as a proxy. This can be used to run them alongside AdGuard in local VPN mode.  Contrary to a popular opinion, using a proxy server is not just about bypassing access restriction to geoblocked resources. It is about security! If you are using a proxy server, intruders won't know what websites you visit. You can also use AdGuard along with the anonymity network TOR (we have already integrated AdGuard with Tor for your convenience!).

Now you can add any userscripts by URL or load them from a file, and AdGuard will serve as a userscript manager and take care of the rest.

Both apps will detect each other and do everything that's needed for smooth joint work. All that will be left for you is to enjoy both ad-free Internet and the benefits of a VPN. It also works the other way around just as well: install AdGuard Ad Blocker on top of an already-running AdGuard VPN and you're good. If you'd like to disable Compatibility Mode for any reason, it's very simple to do so from AdGuard Ad Blocker settings, just toggle the switch.

Selecting Custom DNS allows you to list IPv4 and IPv6 server addresses to use as upstreams. Fallback domains​ Here you can list domains that will be forwarded directly to fallback upstreams if they exist. Detect search domains​ If this option is enabled, AdGuard will detect search domains and automatically forward them to fallback upstreams.

As a result, you stop seeing ads on your web pages and life gets lots better. Some filter lists (AdGuard’s Base filter, Annoyances filter, EasyList, etc.) are pre-installed, while other specific ones, adapted to your preferences, can be downloaded additionally and added to your program. Aside from the more general and universally applicable filters (like Base filter), AdGuard provides an extensive quantity of filters for every occasion: filters aimed at tracking prevention (like Tracking Protection filter),language-specific ad filters that block content in a selected language,Social media filter that removes &quot;Like&quot; and &quot;Share&quot; buttons,Annoyances filter for cookie warnings, in-page pop-ups and others of the same ilk,and even a filter that unblocks some ads instead of blocking them — Filter for search ads and self-promotions. AdGuard filters are automatically updated. Our developers create them all based on user feedback received. You can always help other AdGuard users (and yourself, in perspective) by sending us reports right from the app's Assistant (it's really handy, we'll tell you more about the Assistant further on), or from the website.

What it does is protection from malicious and phishing websites. nota AdGuard is not an antivirus, but an entirely different program. It will show you a warning if you are about to go onto an infected domain, but it cannot stop you from downloading anything suspicious or help you deal with already existing viruses. Phishing is a very common web fraud aimed at stealing personal data (passwords, bank account details, etc.). It is carried out using fake web pages mimicking popular websites or real services, such as web stores or social networks. Many phishing websites have URLs that only differ from the real ones in just a few symbols to put you off your guard. If a user enters their details on such a website, they’ll definitely end up in the wrong hands. Browsing Security gives strong protection against such incidents. At the same time, the user’s personal information is not transferred anywhere, and AdGuard servers do not know which websites the user is visiting, because the security check is not performed via open web address (URL) but through hash prefixes (hash is a certain data structure that renders each address added to the base unambiguous). Some web pages are not malicious themselves, but they may contain elements built into their structure by other websites. Unlike browser plug-ins, Browsing Security module checks each object built into any web page, ensuring maximum protection. If you wish to help us in perfecting this module, you can check the lower box on the panel near the &quot;Help us with Browsing Security filters development&quot; phrase.

Like Browser Assistant, legacy Assistant works with all macOS compatible browsers. Thanks to this little tool you can do several things without having to leave the browser: add a certain webpage to the &quot;do not block&quot; list, choose and block an especially annoying element on the page, report the website if it still manages to get ads through to you. nota This version of Assistant is legacy and there is no point in using it on new systems, since it has been replaced with the full-fledged Browser Assistant.

Most data including ads is transferred via it, but it has one disadvantage — the connection is unencrypted. Thanks to the HTTPS filtering feature AdGuard has, not only HTTP traffic is filtered, but also HTTPS traffic (S stands for ‘secure’). There are also the options of &quot;Do not filter websites with EV certificates&quot; and &quot;Use AdGuard as an HTTP Proxy&quot;. Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates offer a stronger safety guarantee; owners of such websites have to pass a thorough and globally standardized identity verification process defined by EV guidelines. Which is the reason why some users trust websites with such certificates and prefer not to filter them. As for the second option — well, yes, in fact you can use AdGuard as a regular HTTP proxy server. All traffic coming through it will be filtered. This proxy will also be available on your local network, so you may use it for traffic filtering on other devices that are able to reach the proxy directly. To filter traffic on another device connected to proxy you will need to install an AdGuard root certificate there. After you configure proxy, open your browser and go to this page.

Compatibility with iCloud Private Relay​ Currently, AdGuard and iCloud Private Relay cannot work at the same time. AdGuard has no ability to block ads because iCloud Private Relay encrypts traffic before AdGuard can filter network connections. When iCloud Private Relay is active, any filtering (including local filtering) becomes impossible. Thus, AdGuard can't filter traffic or perform DNS filtering in Safari. That's why by default, AdGuard uses the &quot;default route&quot; which disables iCloud Private Relay. For a deeper understanding of this problem, read this article. Recommended solution We recommend using AdGuard together with a more traditional VPN service such as AdGuard VPN. Alternative solution You can prevent AdGuard from using the &quot;default route&quot; by disabling it. It can be done via Advanced Settings → network.extension.monterey.force.split.tunnel. Note that enabling this setting will cause the problems described above.  Compatibility with Protect Mail Activity​ Apple's Mail app now uses a proxy to hide a user's IP address when downloading images from emails. However, it won't work if there's an active VPN connection. As it treats AdGuard as a VPN, it won't preload images automatically. For a deeper understanding of this problem, read this article.

Compatibility with Cisco AnyConnect​ AdGuard will not work together with Cisco AnyConnect while in the Network Extension mode. You have to switch AdGuard to Automatic Proxy mode. To do so, follow this instruction. Compatibility with Flutter​ This problem is solved in Flutter 2.2, released in June 2021. But to fix it for applications developed in Flutter, you need to wait for updates. If you use Flutter alongside AdGuard in &quot;Network Extension&quot; mode (or any other &quot;Transparent Proxy&quot;-type app) in Monterey or Big Sur, you will run into problems: projects won't open and Flutter will be effectively broken. We have already reported this bug to Apple. Meanwhile, you can use these temporary solutions: 1) Use AdGuard in Automatic Proxy mode. 2) Disable SIP and switch AdGuard to Kernel Extension mode as explained here. VPN apps with legacy API​ Despite AdGuard is displayed as a VPN in system settings, it shouldn't cause any conflicts when working alongside other VPN-based apps. However, if you're using a VPN-based app that was downloaded from outside App Store, there's a chance it uses the old VPN API and you have to exclude it from filtering: 1) Open AdGuard's menu. 2) Select Preferences.... 3) Switch to the Network tab. 4) Click the Applications... button. 5) Find the app you want to exclude and uncheck the checkbox next to it.

If you encounter any issues in OS versions 11.1+, or if you're using Big Sur 11.0, remove the local proxy from System settings and configure an upstream proxy in AdGuard by following the instruction below. To configure an upstream proxy in AdGuard for Mac in Big Sur, you need to go to AdGuard menu → Advanced → Advanced Settings.... Click on the Value area of the upstream.proxy setting to configure a proxy.  Enter a string that looks like scheme://user:password@host:port, where scheme is either http, https, socks4 or socks5, depending on your proxy type, If you use socks5 proxy type, set the value of the upstream.proxy.socks5udp setting to true to make AdGuard route UDP traffic to the proxy server. user and password are corresponding username and password of your proxy (if needed). Ignore either or both when not applicable,host is the IP address of your proxy server,port is the desired port number to be used by the proxy server. Example socks5://localhost:6322 will configure a SOCKS5 local proxy that listens to port 6322 and doesn't require a username or a password. Click Apply to make AdGuard route all traffic that went through it to the configured proxy server. If you run into any problems, please contact our tech support at support@adguard.com. Example 1: Configuring an upstream Shadowsocks proxy​ Here's an example of how to configure an upstream proxy for Shadowsocks. First of all, you need a working server side for your proxy. Most likely, to set it up, you would use a JSON file like this (server and password values were chosen randomly here): { &quot;server&quot;:&quot;111.222.333.444&quot;, &quot;server_port&quot;:8388, &quot;local_port&quot;:1080, &quot;password&quot;:&quot;barfoo!&quot;, &quot;timeout&quot;:600, &quot;method&quot;:&quot;chacha20-ietf-poly1305&quot; }  consejo You can find more information about how to get started on Shadowsocks website. Then you'd have to install Shadowsocks client on your Mac. Make sure that you select 'Manual Mode' or 'Auto Mode' in its settings! The configuration won't work if you select 'Global Mode' (or 'Auto Mode' in Big Sur versions prior to 11.1).  Now go to AdGuard menu → Advanced → Advanced Settings... and set the Value area of the upstream.proxy setting to socks5://localhost:1080. Notice that you need to use &quot;local_port&quot; value from the JSON file here. Because Shadowsocks uses SOCKS5, you also need to set the value of the upstream.proxy.socks5udp setting in AdGuard Advanced Settings to true to make AdGuard route UDP traffic to the proxy server. Example 2: Configuring an upstream Surge proxy​ In Big Sur v11.1+, there are no known conflicts between AdGuard and Surge proxy. If you are using an older version of Big Sur (prior to 11.1), check that System Proxy in the bottom right corner is disabled. Otherwise, Surge won't work with AdGuard. On the other hand, Enhanced Mode can be enabled without causing a conflict in any Big Sur version.  Now go to AdGuard menu → Advanced → Advanced Settings... and set the Value area of the upstream.proxy setting to socks5://localhost:6153 or http://localhost:6152, depending on which type of proxy you want to use. Notice that you need to use port value that's indicated in the Events area of the Activity tab in your Surge client. If you chose SOCKS5 protocol, you also need to set the value of the upstream.proxy.socks5udp setting in AdGuard Advanced Settings to true to make AdGuard route UDP traffic to the proxy server.

In 2019, Apple put limitations on ad blockers for Safari, allowing them to use only 50,000 filtering rules simultaneously. As this number was not enough for an ad blocker to provide a good filtering quality (AdGuard Base Filter alone has 30,000 filtering rules), we divided AdGuard for Safari into six content blockers each containing up to 50,000 rules. In 2022, Apple increased the filtering rule limit for each content blocker to 150,000 rules applied simultaneously. Regarding AdGuard for Safari, up to 900,000 rules can be enabled for all six content blockers. Whereas the limit has been increased, the structure of content blockers has remained the same.

The name of this extension is quite deliberate: it actually assists the user in changing basic AdGuard settings right in the browser, without the need to open the app itself. AdGuard Assistant works with all Microsoft Windows compatible browsers. In addition, the AdGuard Assistant icon will not be displayed on websites listed as exceptions by the user and on certain web pages where there is a risk of incorrect content display. AdGuard Extra This is a custom extension designed to fight the technique of re-inserting blocked ads — the so-called ad blocker circumvention/ad reinjection. Both are advanced anti-ad blocker methods that continue to rise in popularity among advertisers. AdGuard Extra is essentially a mini-program that changes the way pages work,and it does so in such a way that it becomes much more difficult for sites to use the above-mentioned functions to bypass blockers. AdGuard Popup Blocker This extension prevents popup windows from opening when you view web pages. Some pop-ups are considered useful – they may contain settings for site administering or additional reference information demonstrated upon clicking a link.

You can also enable the Filter websites with EV certificates feature. Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates offer a stronger safety guarantee; owners of such websites have to pass a thorough and globally standardized identity verification process defined by EV guidelines.

They interpret filtering rules and perform actions on web traffic based on what the rules tell them to do: block specific elements, alter web pages in certain ways, etc.  "},{"title":"Filter lists​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#filter-lists","content":"To better understand ad blocking, it's important to know the underlying principles of how filters work. Filtering rules that make up filters are not created automatically. They are developed by filter maintainers, including professionals and volunteers, who use browser developer consoles and other tools (such as the AdGuard's filtering log) to determine which rules will block a particular ad or tracker. This description of the process is very simplistic – some ads are particularly hard to block and require multiple rules, multiple iterations, and the use of complex syntax. And even when a rule finally gets added to a filter, it doesn't mean that it stays there forever. Ads change, ways to serve the same ads on the same websites change, and the filter rules have to change, too. Sometimes rules become obsolete, a new ad appears, or a new filtering rule is needed to block the same ad. Filters are often maintained by one person, but even for a team of maintainers, it's impossible to constantly monitor the entire web. That's why many ad blockers have tools to help users easily report any filter-related issues they encounter.  AdGuard users have access to a special web reporting tool. Thanks to user complaints, filter developers can focus on correcting their filter lists and not on scouring the Internet for new and old unblocked ads. Filters can do more than just block ads. There are filters that block tracking, social media widgets, and annoyances such as cookie notices. Different users may choose different combinations of filters to match their personal preferences. There are websites like filterlists.com that are dedicated to filter lists and have huge databases. We develop and maintain our own set of filter lists that can be used with AdGuard or other ad blockers. "},{"title":"Types of filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#types-of-filtering-rules","content":"There are many types of filtering rules that serve different purposes. Depending on the ad blocker you use, and especially on your OS, some types of rules may not be supported. "},{"title":"Basic filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#basic-filtering-rules","content":"To be displayed on a web page or in an app, the ad has to be loaded from a server first. To do so, the browser or the app needs to send a web request. The most basic way of preventing an ad from appearing on your screen is to block this request so it never reaches the server, and thus there's no reply. Basically, all AdGuard Ad Blocker products can block web requests according to the active filter rules. This method is very effective at stopping the ad, but it has some drawbacks. The most obvious one is: whatever place an ad was taking up will be left empty or occupied by an ad leftover. "},{"title":"Cosmetic filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#cosmetic-filtering-rules","content":"Every web page has a Document Object Model (DOM), an HTML document containing the structure and elements of this page. As ads are also page elements, they get recorded in the DOM. Ad blockers can remove parts of the DOM, while filtering rules help them understand which parts are ads and should be removed, and which parts should be left intact. This method allows you to avoid above-mentioned blank spaces and ad leftovers, as well as perform other more complicated tasks. "},{"title":"HTML filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#html-filtering-rules","content":"In most cases, it's enough to use the above-mentioned basic and cosmetic rules to filter ads. But when it is necessary to change the HTML code of the page itself before it is loaded, you need filtering rules for HTML content. These rules allow you to specify the HTML elements to be cut out before the browser even loads the page. These rules are quite complicated and require the ad blocker to be granted certain access rights, so not all platforms support them. Currently, these rules work only in the AdGuard Firefox add-on and in the AdGuard apps for Windows, Mac, and Android. información There are other types of filtering rules, but they require more advanced technical knowledge to understand how they work.

Please read the technical explanation below. AdGuard is a network-level content blocker so it cannot simply add custom JavaScript and CSS to webpages like what browser extensions do. However, doing this is crucial for quality content blocking.In order to do it AdGuard injects a &quot;content script&quot; that looks like this: &lt;script src=&quot;https://local.adguard.org/.../content-script.js&quot;&gt;. This &quot;content script&quot; takes care of cosmetic filtering, hides or removes ad content from the web pages.Connections to the IP address of the local.adguard.org domain are intercepted by AdGuard on the network level and processed locally. This is why that domain has a &quot;static&quot; IP address that does not change for years. Why do we need to use a real IP address for that? We cannot use 127.0.0.1 as the browsers won't accept it.Using some IP address from the private subnets is possible, but this solution has two downsides. First, there is a slight chance of intersecting with an existing intranet service and breaking access to it.Second, some DNS servers may consider this a DNS rebinding attack and refuse to respond to local.adguard.org.

This protocol is used to securely transmit valuable information like personal data, credit card details, etc. Using HTTPS is highly advantageous because encrypted traffic is protected against eavesdropping by a third party, and we can only welcome this. HTTPS acceptance has been growing in recent years, mainly because it is encouraged by Google and also due to the emergence of a free certificate authority Let’s Encrypt. The diagram below describes the difference between plain HTTP protocol and secure HTTPS protocol.  "},{"title":"What is a security certificate?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is HTTPS filtering","url":"general/https-filtering/what-is-https-filtering/#what-is-a-security-certificate","content":"Simply put, HTTPS means data encryption. But there’s still a problem: how can you be sure that you’ve established an encrypted connection with the right website? That’s where security certificates come into play. A certificate serves as proof that the website is really what it tells you it is. If a website doesn’t have such a certificate, or if the certificate contains incorrect information, the browser will not allow you to establish a secure connection. It is important that the certificate a website uses is issued by a certificate authority (CA) trusted by your browser. Such a CA guarantees that the SSL certificate is, indeed, issued to the website’s owner.

When a browser attempts to connect to a server, AdGuard establishes two secure connections: one with the browser (or another app) and the other with the server. The browser must trust AdGuard and the connections it creates. For this purpose, AdGuard generates a special (and unique) root certificate and installs it into the system and, when it is required, into some browsers (e.g., Firefox). Thus, AdGuard can see what is happening inside the secure connection and do its job — block ads and trackers. For better understanding we depicted this process:  "},{"title":"Does my traffic remain encrypted and secure?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is HTTPS filtering","url":"general/https-filtering/what-is-https-filtering/#does-my-traffic-remain-encrypted-and-secure","content":"Of course!

Instead, the browser sees the certificate issued by AdGuard. Because of this, we have taken additional measures to improve connection security.

It is usually done by various kinds of antivirus software. The bad news is that 24 out of 26 tested antiviruses reduced, in various ways, the connection security level, while two-thirds created connections prone to hacking. The researchers came to a simple conclusion: the Internet security community should pay close attention to applications that filter secure connections. And the developers of such software must pay serious attention to the quality of filtering implementations. We would like to note that AdGuard was not tested in the above study. We ran estimates according to their set of tests, and at the time of testing, we could have received the maximum score – A*. However, this score is not perfect. During the study, the researchers identified some issues that were omitted in the final evaluation. Here at AdGuard, we fully agree with those conclusions. Moreover, we would like to be as open with users as possible and talk about the problems we are currently experiencing and the steps we are taking to improve the quality and security of the filtering mechanism. The list of these problems is sorted by priority. Most of the problems discovered in the above study are related to certificate validation mechanisms. This is what we want to focus on first. We are working on a separate certificate validation library. Moreover, we want to make it open source. A separate article lists all the known drawbacks of HTTPS filtering in AdGuard and our plans to fix them. HTTPS filtering issues on Android 7+​ Starting from Android 7, developers have to explicitly indicate that their apps trust user-installed certificates. Not everyone wants to, or bothers with it. What does it mean for AdGuard? AdGuard installs a user certificate to be able to filter HTTPS traffic. If an app doesn't trust this certificate, its HTTPS traffic will not be filtered. What to do? The first thing worth mentioning is that many apps (even modern ones) still trust user certificates. Nothing has changed in this regard. Almost all browsers also trust such certificates. There may be some exotic browsers that do not, but they are a rare exception to common practice. Finally, if your device is rooted, you can move the AdGuard certificate to the system storage. This way, you don't have to worry about any permissions a particular app may or may not have — HTTPS traffic will be filtered for modern apps just as well as for older ones. Please keep in mind that in this case, some additional security restrictions (e.g., HPKP or Expect-CT) apply to AdGuard.

It contains the URL of the request source. When you navigate from one page to another, Referrer saves the URL of the initial page. The server that hosts the destination web page often has software that parses Referrer and extracts various pieces of information from it. Enabling the Hide Referrer from third-parties option hides the current website from third-party sites by altering the HTTP header. You can also set an arbitrary value for Referrer by entering it into the Custom Referrer field. To use default Referrer, leave the field blank. Note that to be able to filter traffic, AdGuard applications 'intercept' browser-to-server requests. Requests to ad, tracking, and phishing servers may be altered before sending them to the server or blocked completely. Same goes for the Hide Referrer from third parties option: AdGuard intercepts HTTP(S) requests, in particular to remove or change the Referrer header if this option is enabled. However, it happens only after these requests “leave” the browser. This means that if you monitor Referrer inside the browser (for example, with the help of Chrome's Developer Tools), you will see the original Referrer because the request hasn't reached AdGuard yet. You can use software like Fiddler to make sure that Referrer gets altered correctly. On the opposite, due to the nature of all browser extensions, AdGuard Browser Extension works 'inside' the browser.

It means, || stands for http://*., https://*., ws://*., wss://*. at once.^ — a separator character mark. Separator character is any character, but a letter, a digit, or one of the following: _ - . %. In this example separator characters are shown in bold: http://example.com/?t=1&amp;t2=t3. The end of the address is also accepted as separator.| — a pointer to the beginning or the end of address. The value depends on the character placement in the mask. For example, a rule swf| corresponds to http://example.com/annoyingflash.swf , but not to http://example.com/swf/index.html. |http://example.org corresponds to http://example.org, but not to http://domain.com?url=http://example.org.

Exclusion rule with regular expression looks like this: @@/banner\\d+/.

Compatibility In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard Browser Extension rules with wildcard .* match any public suffix (or eTLD).

Basically, they just limit the scope of rule application. $app​ This modifier lets you narrow the rule coverage down to a specific application (or a list of applications). This might be not too important on Windows and Mac, but this is very important on mobile devices where some of the filtering rules must be app-specific. Android — use the app package name, e.g. org.example.app.Windows — use the process name, e.g. chrome.exe.Mac — use the bundle ID or the process name, e.g. com.google.Chrome. For Mac, you can find out the bundle ID or the process name of the app by viewing the respective request details in the Filtering log. Examples ||baddomain.com^$app=org.example.app — a rule to block requests that match the specified mask and are sent from the org.example.app Android app.||baddomain.com^$app=org.example.app1|org.example.app2 — the same rule but it works for both org.example.app1 and org.example.app2 apps. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain apps, start the app name with the ~ sign. ||baddomain.com^$app=~org.example.app — a rule to block requests that match the specified mask and are sent from any app save for the org.example.app.||baddomain.com^$app=~org.example.app1|~org.example.app2 — same as above, but now two apps are excluded: org.example.app1 and org.example.app2. Compatibility Only AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android are technically capable of using rules with $app modifier.On Windows the process name is case-insensitive starting with AdGuard for Windows versions that have CoreLibs v1.12 under the hood. $denyallow​ $denyallow modifier allows to avoid creating additional rules when it is needed to disable a certain rule for specific domains. $denyallow matches only target domains and not referrer domains. Adding this modifier to a rule is equivalent to excluding the domains by the rule's matching pattern or to adding the corresponding exclusion rules. To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Examples This rule: *$script,domain=a.com|b.com,denyallow=x.com|y.com  is equivalent to this one: /^(?!.*(x.com|y.com)).*$/$script,domain=a.com|b.com  or to the combination of these three: *$script,domain=a.com|b.com @@||x.com$script,domain=a.com|b.com @@||y.com$script,domain=a.com|b.com  Restrictions The rule's matching pattern cannot target any specific domains, e.g. it cannot start with ||.Domains in the modifier value cannot be negated, e.g. $denyallow=~x.com, or have a wildcard TLD, e.g. $denyallow=x.*. The rules which violate these restrictions are considered invalid. Compatibility Rules with $denyallow modifier are not supported by AdGuard for iOS, Safari, and AdGuard Content Blocker. $domain​ $domain limits the rule scope to requests made from the specified domains and their subdomains (as indicated by the Referer HTTP header). To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Examples Just $domain: ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org blocks requests that match the specified mask, and are sent from domain example.org or its subdomains.||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|example.com — the same rule, but it works for both example.org and example.com. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain domains, start a domain name with ~ sign. $domain and negation ~: ||baddomain.com^$domain=~example.org blocks requests matching the pattern sent from any domain except example.org and its subdomains.||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|~foo.example.org blocks requests sent from example.org and its subdomains, except the subdomain foo.example.org. $domain modifier matching target domain: In some cases the $domain modifier can match not only the referrer domain, but also the target domain. This happens when all of the following is true: The request has document content type.The rule pattern does not match any particular domains.The rule pattern does not contain regular expressions.The $domain modifier contains only excluded domains, e.g. $domain=~example.org|~example.com. The following predicate should be satisfied to perform a target domain matching: 1 AND ((2 AND 3) OR 4)  That is, if the modifier $domain contains only excluded domains, then the rule does not need to meet the second and third conditions to match the target domain against the modifier $domain. If some of the conditions above are not met but the rule contains $cookie or $csp modifier, the target domain will still be matched. If the referrer matches a rule with $domain that explicitly excludes the referrer domain, then the rule will not be applied even if the target domain also matches the rule. This affects rules with $cookie and $csp modifiers, too. Examples *$cookie,domain=example.org|example.com will block cookies for all requests to and from example.org and example.com.*$document,domain=example.org|example.com will block all requests to and from example.org and example.com. In the following examples it is implied that requests are sent from http://example.org/page (the referrer) and the target URL is http://targetdomain.com/page. page$domain=example.org will be matched, as it matches the referrer domain.page$domain=targetdomain.com will be matched, as it matches the target domain and satisfies all requirements mentioned above.||*page$domain=targetdomain.com will not be matched, as the pattern ||*page may match specific domains, e.g. example.page.||*page$domain=targetdomain.com,cookie will be matched because the rule contains $cookie modifier despite the pattern ||*page may match specific domains./banner\\d+/$domain=targetdomain.com will not be matched as it contains a regular expression.page$domain=targetdomain.com|~example.org will not be matched because the referrer domain is explicitly excluded. Limitations Safari does not support the simultaneous use of allowed and disallowed domains, so rules like ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|~foo.example.org will not work in AdGuard for iOS and AdGuard for Safari. Compatibility In AdGuard for Windows, Mac and Android running CoreLibs version 1.12 or later the $domain modifier can be alternatively spelled as $from. $header​ The $header modifier allows matching the HTTP response having a specific header with (optionally) a specific value. Syntax $header &quot;=&quot; h_name [&quot;:&quot; h_value] h_value = string / regexp  where: h_name — required, an HTTP header name. It is matched case-insesitively.h_value — optional, an HTTP header value matching expression, it may be one of the following: string — a sequence of characters. It is matched against the header value lexicographically;regexp — a regular expression, starts and ends with /. The pattern works the same way as in the basic URL rules, but the characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \\. The modifier &quot;:&quot; h_value part may be omitted. In that case the modifier matches the header name only. Examples ||example.com^$header=set-cookie:foo blocks requests whose responses have the Set-Cookie header with the value matching foo literally.||example.com^$header=set-cookie blocks requests whose responses have the Set-Cookie header with any value.@@||example.com^$header=set-cookie:/foo\\, bar\\$/ unblocks requests whose responses have the Set-Cookie header with value matching the foo, bar$ regular expression.@@||example.com^$header=set-cookie unblocks requests whose responses have a Set-Cookie header with any value. Compatibility Rules with the $header modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.11 or later. $important​ The $important modifier applied to a rule increases its priority over any other rule without $important modifier. Even over basic exception rules. Go to rules priorities for more details. Examples ! blocking rule will block all requests despite of the exception rule ||example.org^$important @@||example.org^  ! if the exception rule also has `$important` modifier, it will prevail and requests won't be blocked ||example.org^$important @@||example.org^$important  $match-case​ This modifier defines a rule which applies only to addresses that match the case. Default rules are case-insensitive. Examples */BannerAd.gif$match-case — this rule will block http://example.com/BannerAd.gif, but not http://example.com/bannerad.gif. $method​ This modifier limits the rule scope to requests that use the specified set of HTTP methods. Negated methods are allowed. The methods must be specified in all lowercase characters, but are matched case-insensitively. To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Examples ||evil.com^$method=get|head blocks only GET and HEAD requests to evil.com.||evil.com^$method=~post|~put blocks any requests to evil.com except POST or PUT.@@||evil.com$method=get unblocks only GET requests to evil.com.@@||evil.com$method=~post unblocks any requests to evil.com except POST. Please note, that rules with mixed value restriction are considered invalid. So, for example, the rule ||evil.com^$method=get|~head will be rejected. Compatibility Rules with the $method are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, running CoreLibs v1.12 or later, and AdGuard Browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, running TSUrlFilter v2.1.1 or later. $popup​ AdGuard will try to close the browser tab with any address that matches a blocking rule with this modifier. Please note that not all the tabs can be closed. Examples ||domain.com^$popup — if you try to go to http://domain.com/ from any page in the browser, a new tab in which specified site has to be opened will be closed by this rule. Compatibility $popup modifier works best in AdGuard Browser Extension.In AdGuard for Safari and iOS, $popup rules simply block the page right away.In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, $popup modifier may not detect a popup in some cases and it won't be blocked. $popup modifier applies the document content type with a special flag which is passed to a blocking page. Blocking page itself can do some checks and close the window if it is really a popup. Otherwise, page should be loaded. It can be combined with other request type modifiers, such as $third-party and $important. $third-party​ A restriction of third-party and own requests. A third-party request is a request from a different domain. For example, a request to example.org from domain.com is a third-party request. nota To be considered as such, a third-party request should meet one of the following conditions: Its referrer is not a subdomain of the target domain or vice versa. For example, a request to subdomain.example.org from example.org is not a third-party request.Its Sec-Fetch-Site header is set to cross-site. If there is a $third-party modifier, the rule is only applied to third-party requests. Examples $third-party: ||domain.com^$third-party — this rule applies to all domains, except domain.com and its subdomains. An example of a third-party request: http://example.org/banner.jpg. If there is a $~third-party modifier, the rule is only applied to the requests that are not from third parties. Which means, they have to be sent from the same domain. $~third-party: ||domain.com$~third-party — this rule is applied to domain.com, but not to the other domains. Example of a request that is not a third-party request: http://domain.com/icon.ico. $to​ $to limits the rule scope to requests made to the specified domains and their subdomains. To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Examples /ads$to=evil.com|evil.org blocks any request to evil.com or evil.org and their subdomains with a path matching /ads./ads$to=~not.evil.com|evil.com blocks any request to evil.com and its subdomains, with a path matching /ads, except requests to not.evil.com and its subdomains./ads$to=~good.com|~good.org blocks any request with a path matching /ads, except requests to good.com or good.org and their subdomains. Limitations $denyallow can not be used together with $to. It can be expressed with inverted $to: $denyallow=a.com|b.com is equivalent to $to=~a.com|~b.com. Compatibility Rules with the $to modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.12 or later.

These modifiers can also be combined to cover, for example, both images and scripts. Compatibility There is a big difference in how AdGuard determines the content type on different platforms. For AdGuard Browser Extension, content type for every request is provided by the browser. AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android use following method: first we try to determine the type of the request by the Sec-Fetch-Dest request header or by the filename extension. If the request is not blocked at this stage, the type will be determined using the Content-Type header at the beginning of the server response. Content type modifiers examples ||example.org^$image — corresponds to all images from example.org.||example.org^$script,stylesheet — corresponds to all the scripts and styles from example.org.||example.org^$~image,~script,~stylesheet — corresponds to all requests to example.org except for the images, scripts and styles. $document​ The rule corresponds to the main frame document requests, i.e. HTML documents that are loaded in the browser tab. It does not match iframes, there is a $subdocument modifier for these. By default, AdGuard does not block the requests that are loaded in the browser tab (e.g. &quot;main frame bypass&quot;). The idea is not to prevent pages from loading as the user clearly indicated that they want this page to be loaded. However, if the $document modifier is specified explicitly, AdGuard does not use that logic and prevents the page load. Instead, it responds with a &quot;blocking page&quot;. If this modifier is used with an exclusion rule (@@), it completely disables blocking on corresponding pages. It is equivalent to using $elemhide, $content, $urlblock, $jsinject, $extension modifiers simultaneously. Examples @@||example.com^$document completely disables filtering on all pages at example.com and all subdomains. ||example.com^$document blocks HTML document request to example.com with a blocking page. ||example.com^$document,redirect=noopframe redirects HTML document request to example.com to an empty html document. ||example.com^$document,removeparam=test removes test query parameter from HTML document request to example.com. ||example.com^$document,replace=/test1/test2/ replaces test1 with test2 in HTML document request to example.com. $font​ The rule corresponds to requests for fonts, e.g. .woff filename extension. $image​ The rule corresponds to images requests. $media​ The rule corresponds to requests for media files — music and video, e.g. .mp4 files. $object​ The rule corresponds to browser plugins resources, e.g. Java or Flash. $other​ The rule applies to requests for which the type has not been determined or does not match the types listed above. $ping​ The rule corresponds to requests caused by either navigator.sendBeacon() or the ping attribute on links. Compatibility AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android often cannot accurately detect navigator.sendBeacon(). Using $ping is not recommended in the filter lists that are supposed to be used by CoreLibs-based AdGuard products. $script​ The rule corresponds to script requests, e.g. javascript, vbscript. $stylesheet​ The rule corresponds to CSS files requests. $subdocument​ The rule corresponds to requests for built-in pages — HTML tags frame and iframe. Examples ||example.com^$subdocument blocks built-in page requests (frame and iframe) to example.com and all its subdomains anywhere.||example.com^$subdocument,domain=domain.com blocks built-in page requests (frame и iframe) to example.com (and its subdomains) from domain.com and all its subdomains. $websocket​ The rule applies only to WebSocket connections. Compatibility $websocket modifier is supported in all AdGuard products except AdGuard Content Blocker. As for AdGuard for Safari and AdGuard for iOS, it's supported on devices with macOS Monterey (version 12) and iOS 16 or higher. $xmlhttprequest​ The rule applies only to ajax requests (requests sent via javascript object XMLHttpRequest). Compatibility AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android when filtering older browsers cannot accurately detect this type and sometimes detects it as $other or $script. They can only reliably detect this content type when filtering modern browsers that support Fetch metadata request headers. $object-subrequest (deprecated)​ Deprecation notice $object-subrequest modifier is deprecated and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. The rule corresponds to requests by browser plugins (it is usually Flash). $webrtc (deprecated)​ Deprecation notice This modifier is deprecated and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. If you need to suppress WebRTC, consider using the nowebrtc scriptlet. The rule applies only to WebRTC connections. Examples ||example.com^$webrtc,domain=example.org blocks webRTC connections to example.com for example.org.@@*$webrtc,domain=example.org disables the RTC wrapper for example.org.

The modifier can contain any number of userscript names or not contain them at all. In the latter case the modifier disables all the userscripts. Userscript names usually contain spaces or other special characters, which is why you should enclose the name in quotes. Both single (') and double (&quot;) ASCII quotes are supported. Multiple userscript names should be separated with a pipe (|). However, if a userscript name is a single word without any special characters, it can be used without quotes. You can also exclude a userscript by adding a ~ character before it. In this case, the userscript will not be disabled by the modifier. $extension=~&quot;userscript name&quot;  NOTE: When excluding a userscript, you must place ~ outside the quotes.

In that case, the $badfilter rule will disable the corresponding rule for domains specified in both the $badfilter and basic rules. Please note that wildcard-TLD logic works here as well. Examples /some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is disabled for example.com by /some$domain=example.com,badfilter/some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is disabled for example.com and example.org by /some$domain=example.com|example.org,badfilter/some$domain=example.com|example.org and /some$domain=example.io are disabled completely by /some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io,badfilter/some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is disabled completely by /some$domain=example.*,badfilter/some$domain=example.* is disabled for example.com and example.org by /some$domain=example.com|example.org,badfilter/some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is NOT disabled for example.com by /some$domain=example.com|~example.org,badfilter because the value of $domain modifier contains a negated domain Compatibility Rules with $badfilter modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $cookie​ The $cookie modifier completely changes rule behavior. Instead of blocking a request, this modifier makes AdGuard suppress or modify the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $cookie rules match a single request, we will apply each of them one by one. Syntax $cookie [= name[; maxAge = seconds [; sameSite = strategy ]]]  where: name — optional, string or regular expression to match cookie name.seconds — number of seconds for current time to offset the expiration date of cookie.strategy — string for Same-Site strategy to make cookie use. For example, ||example.org^$cookie=NAME;maxAge=3600;sameSite=lax  every time AdGuard encounters a cookie called NAME in a request to example.org, it will do the following: Set its expiration date to current time plus 3600 secondsMakes the cookie use Same-Site &quot;lax&quot; strategy. Escaping special characters If regular expression name is used for matching, two characters must be escaped: comma , and dollar sign $. Use backslash \\ escape each of them. For example, escaped comma looks like this: \\,. Examples ||example.org^$cookie blocks all cookies set by example.org; this is an equivalent to setting maxAge=0$cookie=__cfduid blocks CloudFlare cookie everywhere$cookie=/__utm[a-z]/ blocks Google Analytics cookies everywhere||facebook.com^$third-party,cookie=c_user prevents Facebook from tracking you even if you are logged in There are two methods to deactivate $cookie rules: the primary method involves using an exception marked with @@ - @@||example.org^$cookie. The alternative method employs a $urlblock exception (also included under the $document exception alias - $elemhide,jsinject,content,urlblock,extension). Here's how it works: @@||example.org^$cookie unblocks all cookies set by example.org@@||example.org^$urlblock unblocks all cookies set by example.org and disables blocking of all requests sent from example.org@@||example.org^$cookie=concept unblocks a single cookie named concept@@||example.org^$cookie=/^_ga_/ unblocks every cookie that matches the regular expression Limitations $cookie rules support a limited list of modifiers: $domain, $~domain, $important, $third-party, and $~third-party. Compatibility Rules with $cookie modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $csp​ This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied to a rule, the rule will not block the matching request. Response headers will be modified instead. información In order to use this type of rules, it is required to have the basic understanding of the Content Security Policy security layer. For the requests matching a $csp rule, we will strengthen response security policy by enhancing the content security policy, similar to the content security policy of the $csp modifier contents. $csp rules are applied independently from any other rule type. Other basic rules have no influence on it save for document-level exceptions (see the examples section below). Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $csp rules match a single request, we will apply each of them. Syntax $csp value syntax is similar to the Content Security Policy header syntax. $csp value can be empty in the case of exception rules. See examples section below. Examples ||example.org^$csp=frame-src 'none' blocks all frames on example.org and its subdomains.@@||example.org/page/*$csp=frame-src 'none' disables all rules with the $csp modifier exactly matching frame-src 'none' on all the pages matching the rule pattern. For instance, the rule above.@@||example.org/page/*$csp disables all the $csp rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern.||example.org^$csp=script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: disables inline scripts on all the pages matching the rule pattern.@@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$urlblock disables all the $csp rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern. Limitations There are a few characters forbidden in the $csp value: ,, $.$csp rules support limited list of modifiers: $domain, $important, $subdocument.Rules with report-* directives are considered invalid. Compatibility Rules with $csp modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $hls​ $hls rules modify the response of a matching request. They are intended as a convenient way to remove segments from HLS playlists (RFC 8216). nota The word &quot;segment&quot; in this document means either a &quot;Media Segment&quot; or a &quot;playlist&quot; as part of a &quot;Master Playlist&quot;: $hls rules do not distinguish between a &quot;Master Playlist&quot; and a &quot;Media Playlist&quot;. Syntax ||example.org^$hls=urlpattern removes segments whose URL matches the URL pattern urlpattern. The pattern works just like the one in basic URL rules, however, the characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \\ inside urlpattern.||example.org^$hls=/regexp/options removes segments where the URL or one of the tags (for certain options, if present) is matched by the regular expression regexp. Available options are: t — instead of testing the segment's URL, test each of the segment's tags against the regular expression. A segment with a matching tag is removed;i — make the regular expression case-insensitive. The characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \\ inside regexp. Exceptions Basic URL exceptions shall not disable rules with $hls modifier. They can be disabled as described below: @@||example.org^$hls disables all $hls rules for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$hls=text disables all $hls rules with the value of the $hls modifier equal to text for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^. consejo $hls rules can also be disabled by $document, $content and $urlblock exception rules. nota When multiple $hls rules match the same request, their effect is cumulative. Examples ||example.org^$hls=\\/videoplayback^?*&amp;source=dclk_video_ads removes all segments with the matching URL.||example.org^$hls=/\\/videoplayback\\/?\\?.*\\&amp;source=dclk_video_ads/i achieves more or less the same with a regular expression instead of a URL pattern.||example.org^$hls=/#UPLYNK-SEGMENT:.*\\,ad/t removes all segments which have the matching tag. Anatomy of an HLS playlist A quick summary of the specification: An HLS playlist is a collection of text lines.A line may be empty, a comment (starts with #), a tag (also starts with #, can only be recognized by name) or a URL.A URL line is called a &quot;segment&quot;.Tags may apply to a single segment, i.e. the first URL line after the tag, to all segments following the tag and until the tag with the same name, or to the whole playlist. Some points specific to the operation of $hls rules: When a segment is removed, all of the tags that apply only to that segment are also removed.When there is a tag that applies to multiple segments, and all of those segments are removed, the tag is also removed.Since there is no way to recognize different kinds of tags by syntax, we recognize all of the tags specified by the RFC, plus some non-standard tags that we have seen in the field. Any lines starting with # and not recognized as a tag are passed through without modification, and are not matched against the rules.We do not match tags that apply to the whole playlist, and $hls rules can not be used to remove them, since $hls rules are intended for removing segments. If you know what you are doing, you can use $replace rules to remove or rewrite just a single tag from the playlist. An example of a transformation done by the rules: Original response #EXTM3U #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10 #EXTINF,5 preroll.ts #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,ad #UPLYNK-KEY:aabb1122 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,segment #UPLYNK-KEY:ccdd2233 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #EXT-X-ENDLIST  Applied rules ||example.org^$hls=preroll ||example.org^$hls=/#UPLYNK-SEGMENT:.*\\,ad/t  Modified response #EXTM3U #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10 #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,segment #UPLYNK-KEY:ccdd2233 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #EXT-X-ENDLIST  Restrictions $hls rules are only allowed in trusted filters.$hls rules are not compatible with any other modifiers except $domain, $third-party, $app, $important, $match-case, and $xmlhttprequest.$hls rules only apply to HLS playlists, which are UTF-8 encoded text starting with the line #EXTM3U. Any other response will not be modified by these rules.$hls rules do not apply if the size of the original response is more than 3 MB. Compatibility Rules with the $hls modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. $inline-script​ $inline-script modifier is a sort of a shortcut for $csp modifier with specific value. E.g. the rule ||example.org^$inline-script is converting into such a rule: ||example.org^$csp=script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: data: blob: mediastream: filesystem:  $inline-font​ $inline-font modifier is a sort of a shortcut for $csp modifier with specific value. E.g. the rule ||example.org^$inline-font is converting into such a rule: ||example.org^$csp=font-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: data: blob: mediastream: filesystem:  $jsonprune​ $jsonprune rules modify the response to a matching request by removing JSON items that match a modified JSONPath expression. They do not modify responses which are not valid JSON documents. In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android running CoreLibs v1.11 or later, $jsonprune also supports modifying JSONP (padded JSON) documents. Syntax ||example.org^$jsonprune=expression removes items that match the modified JSONPath expression expression from the response. Due to the way rule parsing works, the characters $ and , must be escaped with \\ inside expression. The modified JSONPath syntax has the following differences from the original: Script expressions are not supported.The supported filter expressions are: ?(has &lt;key&gt;) — true if the current object has the specified key.?(key-eq &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;) — true if the current object has the specified key, and its value is equal to the specified value.?(key-substr &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;) — true if the specified value is a substring of the value of the specified key of the current object. Whitespace outside of double- or single-quoted strings has no meaning.Both double- and single-quoted strings can be used.Expressions ending with .. are not supported.Multiple array slices can be specified in square brackets. There are various online tools that make working with JSONPath expressions more convenient: https://www.site24x7.com/tools/jsonpath-finder-validator.html https://jsonpathfinder.com/ https://jsonpath.com/ Keep in mind, though, that all JSONPath implementations have unique features/quirks and are subtly incompatible with each other. Exceptions Basic URL exceptions shall not disable rules with $jsonprune modifier. They can be disabled as described below: @@||example.org^$jsonprune disables all $jsonprune rules for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$jsonprune=text disable all $jsonprune rules with the value of the $jsonprune modifier equal to text for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^. $jsonprune rules can also be disabled by $document, $content and $urlblock exception rules. nota When multiple $jsonprune rules match the same request, they are sorted in lexicographical order, the first rule is applied to the original response, and each of the remaining rules is applied to the result of applying the previous one. Examples ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$..[one\\, &quot;two three&quot;] removes all occurrences of the keys &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two three&quot; anywhere in the JSON document. Input { &quot;one&quot;: 1, &quot;two&quot;: { &quot;two three&quot;: 23, &quot;four five&quot;: 45 } }  Output { &quot;two&quot;: { &quot;four five&quot;: 45 } }  ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.a[?(has ad_origin)] removes all children of a that have an ad_origin key. Input { &quot;a&quot;: [ { &quot;ad_origin&quot;: &quot;https://example.org&quot;, &quot;b&quot;: 42 }, { &quot;b&quot;: 1234 } ] }  Output { &quot;a&quot;: [ { &quot;b&quot;: 1234 } ] }  ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.*.*[?(key-eq 'Some key' 'Some value')] removes all items that are at nesting level 3 and have a property &quot;Some key&quot; equal to &quot;Some value&quot;. Input { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Some value&quot;}, &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}}}, &quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: [{&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Some value&quot;}, {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}]} }  Output { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;d&quot;: {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}}}, &quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: [{&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}]} }  Nested JSONPath expressions In AdGuard for Windows, Mac and Android running CoreLibs v1.11 or later, JSONPath expressions may be used as keys in filter expressions. ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.elems[?(has &quot;\\$.a.b.c&quot;)] removes all children of elems which have a property selectable by the JSONPath expression $.a.b.c. Input { &quot;elems&quot;: [ { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: 123}}, &quot;k&quot;: &quot;v&quot; }, { &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: 123}}, &quot;k1&quot;: &quot;v1&quot; } ] }  Output { &quot;elems&quot;: [ { &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: 123}}, &quot;k1&quot;: &quot;v1&quot; } ] }  ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.elems[?(key-eq &quot;\\$.a.b.c&quot; &quot;abc&quot;)] removes all children of elems which have a property selectable by the JSONPath expression $.a.b.c with a value equal to &quot;abc&quot;. Input { &quot;elems&quot;: [ { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: 123}}, }, { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: &quot;abc&quot;}} } ] }  Output { &quot;elems&quot;: [ { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: 123}} } ] }  Restrictions $jsonprune rules are not compatible with any other modifiers except $domain, $third-party, $app, $important, $match-case, and $xmlhttprequest.$jsonprune rules do not apply if the size of the original response is more than 3 MB. Compatibility Rules with the $jsonprune modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. $network​ This is basically a Firewall-like rule allowing to fully block or unblock access to a specified remote address. $network rules match IP addresses only! You cannot use them to block or unblock access to a domain.To match an IPv6 address, you have to use the collapsed syntax, e.g. use [2001:4860:4860::8888]$network instead of [2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888]$network.An allowlist $network rule makes AdGuard bypass data to the matching endpoint, e.g. there will be no further filtering at all.If the IP part starts and ends with / character, it is treated as a regular expression. We recommend to get acquainted with this article for better understanding of regular expressions. Examples 174.129.166.49:3478^$network blocks access to 174.129.166.49:3478 (but not to 174.129.166.49:34788).[2001:4860:4860::8888]:443^$network blocks access to [2001:4860:4860::8888]:443.174.129.166.49$network blocks access to 174.129.166.49:*.@@174.129.166.49$network makes AdGuard bypass data to the endpoint. No other rules will be applied./.+:3[0-9]{4}/$network blocks access to any port from 30000 to 39999./8.8.8.(:?8|4)/$network blocks access to both 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.8.4. Compatibility Only AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android are technically capable of using rules with $network modifier. $permissions​ This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied to a rule, the rule will not block the matching request. Response headers will be modified instead. información In order to use this type of rules, it is required to have a basic understanding of the Permissions Policy security layer. For the requests matching a $permissions rule, AdGuard strengthens response's permissions policy by adding an additional permission policy equal to the $permissions modifier contents. $permissions rules are applied independently from any other rule type. Other basic rules have no influence on it save for document-level exceptions (see the examples section). Multiple rules matching a single request. In case if multiple $permissions rules match a single request, AdGuard will apply each of them. Syntax $permissions value syntax is similar to the Permissions-Policy header syntax with one exception: comma that separates several features MUST be escaped — see examples below. The list of the available directives is available here. $permissions value can be empty in the case of exception rules — see examples below. Examples ||example.org^$permissions=sync-xhr=() disallows synchronous XMLHttpRequest requests across example.org.@@||example.org/page/*$permissions=sync-xhr=() disables all rules with the $permissions modifier exactly matching sync-xhr=() on all the pages matching the rule pattern. For instance, the rule above.@@||example.org/page/*$permissions disables all the $permissions rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern.$domain=example.org|example.com,permissions=oversized-images=()\\, sync-script=()\\, unsized-media=() disallows oversized images, synchronous scripts and unsized media features across example.org and example.com.@@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$urlblock disables all the $permission rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern. Limitations Characters forbidden in the $permissions value: $;$permissions is compatible with the limited list of modifiers: $domain, $important, and $subdocument. Compatibility Rules with the $permissions modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.11 or later. $redirect​ AdGuard is able to redirect web requests to a local &quot;resource&quot;. Syntax AdGuard uses the same filtering rules syntax as uBlock Origin. Also, it is compatible with ABP $rewrite=abp-resource modifier. $redirect is a modifier for the basic filtering rules so rules with this modifier support all other basic modifiers like $domain, $third-party, $script, etc. The value of the $redirect modifier must be the name of the resource that will be used for redirection. Disabling $redirect rules​ ||example.org/script.js$script,redirect=noopjs — this rule redirects all requests to example.org/script.js to the resource named noopjs.||example.org/test.mp4$media,redirect=noopmp4-1s — this rule redirects all requests to example.org/test.mp4 to the resource named noopmp4-1s.@@||example.org^$redirect will disable all $redirect rules for URLs that match ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$redirect=nooptext will disable all rules with $redirect=nooptext for any request that matches ||example.org^. More information on redirects and their usage is available on GitHub. Priorities of $redirect rules​ The priority of $redirect rules is higher than the priority of regular basic blocking rules. This means that if there is a basic blocking rule, the $redirect rule will override it. Allowlist rules with @@ mark have higher priority than $redirect rules. If a basic rule with the $important modifier matches the same URL, it will override the $redirect rule (unless the $redirect rule is also marked as $important). In short: $important &gt; @@ &gt; $redirect &gt; basic rules. Go to rules priorities for more details. Compatibility Rules with $redirect modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari.$redirect in uBlock Origin supports specifying priority, e.g. $redirect=noopjs:42. AdGuard does not support it and instead just discards the priority postfix. $redirect-rule​ This is basically an alias to $redirect since it has the same &quot;redirection&quot; values and the logic is almost similar. The difference is that $redirect-rule is applied only in the case when the target request is blocked by a different basic rule. Go to rules priorities for more details. Negating $redirect-rule works exactly the same way as for regular $redirect rules. Even more than that, @@||example.org^$redirect will negate both $redirect and $redirect-rule rules. Examples ||example.org/script.js ||example.org^$redirect-rule=noopjs  In this case, only requests to example.org/script.js will be &quot;redirected&quot; to noopjs. All other requests to example.org will be kept intact. Compatibility Rules with $redirect-rule modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $referrerpolicy​ These rules allow overriding of a page's referrer policy. Responses to matching requests will have all of their Referrer-Policy headers replaced with a single header with the value equal to the matching rule's modifier value. If the response carries an HTML document with a &lt;meta name=&quot;referrer&quot;... tag, the content attribute of the tag will also be replaced with the modifier value. An exception rule with a modifier value disables the blocking rule with the same modifier value. An exception rule without a modifier value disables all matched referrer-policy rules. If a request matches multiple $referrerpolicy rules not disabled by exceptions, only one of them (it is not specified which one) is applied. Examples ||example.com^$referrerpolicy=unsafe-url overrides the referrer policy for example.com with unsafe-url.@@||example.com^$referrerpolicy=unsafe-url disables the previous rule.@@||example.com/abcd.html^$referrerpolicy disables all $referrerpolicy rules on example.com/abcd.html. Compatibility with other modifiers $referrerpolicy rules are compatible only with $document and $subdocument content type modifiers. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard $referrerpolicy is available starting with CoreLibs v1.12. $removeheader​ Rules with $removeheader modifier are intended to remove headers from HTTP requests and responses. The initial motivation for this rule type is to be able to get rid of the Refresh header which is often used to redirect users to an undesirable location. However, this is not the only case where this modifier can be useful. Just like $csp, $redirect, $removeparam, and $cookie, this modifier exists independently, rules with it do not depend on the regular basic rules, i.e. regular exception or blocking rules will not affect it. By default, it only affects response headers. However, you can also change it to remove headers from HTTP requests as well. Syntax Basic syntax ||example.org^$removeheader=header-name removes a response header called header-name||example.org^$removeheader=request:header-name removes a request header called header-name $removeheader is case-insensitive, but we suggest always using lower case. Negating $removeheader This type of rules works pretty much the same way it works with $csp and $redirect modifiers. Use @@ to negate $removeheader: @@||example.org^$removeheader negates all $removeheader rules for URLs that match ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$removeheader=header negates the rule with $removeheader=header for any request matching ||example.org^. $removeheader rules can also be disabled by $document and $urlblock exception rules. But basic exception rules without modifiers will not do that. For example, @@||example.com^ will not disable $removeheader=p for requests to example.com, but @@||example.com^$urlblock will. nota In case of multiple $removeheader rules matching a single request, we will apply each of them one by one. Examples ||example.org^$removeheader=refresh removes Refresh header from all HTTP responses returned by example.org and its subdomains.||example.org^$removeheader=request:x-client-data removes X-Client-Data header from all HTTP requests.Next block of rules removes Refresh and Location headers from all HTTP responses returned by example.org save for requests to example.org/path/*, for which no headers will be removed: ||example.org^$removeheader=refresh ||example.org^$removeheader=location @@||example.org/path/$removeheader  Restrictions This type of rules can be used only in trusted filters. In order to avoid compromising the security $removeheader cannot remove headers from the list below: access-control-allow-originaccess-control-allow-credentialsaccess-control-allow-headersaccess-control-allow-methodsaccess-control-expose-headersaccess-control-max-ageaccess-control-request-headersaccess-control-request-methodorigintiming-allow-originallowcross-origin-embedder-policycross-origin-opener-policycross-origin-resource-policycontent-security-policycontent-security-policy-report-onlyexpect-ctfeature-policyorigin-isolationstrict-transport-securityupgrade-insecure-requestsx-content-type-optionsx-download-optionsx-frame-optionsx-permitted-cross-domain-policiesx-powered-byx-xss-protectionpublic-key-pinspublic-key-pins-report-onlysec-websocket-keysec-websocket-extensionssec-websocket-acceptsec-websocket-protocolsec-websocket-versionp3psec-fetch-modesec-fetch-destsec-fetch-sitesec-fetch-userreferrer-policycontent-typecontent-lengthacceptaccept-encodinghostconnectiontransfer-encodingupgrade $removeheader rules are not compatible with any other modifiers except $domain, $third-party, $app, $important, $match-case, and content type modifiers, e.g. $script, $stylesheet, etc. The rules which have any other modifiers are considered invalid and will be discarded. Compatibility Rules with $removeheader modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, and AdGuard Browser Extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. $removeparam​ nota $queryprune is an alias of $removeparam. Since $queryprune is deprecated, avoid using it and use $removeparam instead. Rules with $removeparam modifier are intended to strip query parameters from requests' URLs. Please note that such rules are only applied to GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and sometimes POST requests. $removeparam rules that do not have any content type modifiers will match only requests where content type is document. Syntax Basic syntax $removeparam=param removes query parameter with the name param from URLs of any request, e.g. a request to http://example.com/page?param=1&amp;another=2 will be transformed into http://example.com/page?another=2. $removeparam basic syntax is supported starting with v1.7 of CoreLibs and v3.6 of AdGuard Browser Extension. Regular expressions You can also use regular expressions to match query parameters and/or their values: $removeparam=/regexp/[options] — removes query parameters that matches the regexp regular expression from URLs of any request. Unlike basic syntax, it means &quot;remove query parameters normalized to a name=value string which match the regexp regular expression&quot;. [options] here is the list of regular expression options. At the moment, the only supported option is i which makes matching case-insensitive. Escaping special characters Do not forget to escape special characters like ,, / and $ in the regular expressions. Use \\ character for that purpose. For example, an escaped comma should look like this: \\,. nota Regexp-type rules target both name and value of the parameter. To minimize mistakes, it is safer to start every regexp with /^ unless you specifically target parameter values. We will try to detect and ignore unescaped $ automatically using a simple rule of thumb: It is not an options delimiter if all three are true: It looks like $/;There is another slash character / to the left of it;There is another unescaped dollar sign $ to the left of that slash character. Remove all query parameters Specify naked $removeparam to remove all query parameters: ||example.org^$removeparam — removes all query parameters from URLs matching ||example.org^. Inversion Use ~ to apply inversion: $removeparam=~param — removes all query parameters with the name different from param.$removeparam=~/regexp/ — removes all query parameters that do not match the regexp regular expression. Negating $removeparam This sort of rules work pretty much the same way it works with $csp and $redirect modifiers. Use @@ to negate $removeparam: @@||example.org^$removeparam negates all $removeparam rules for URLs that match ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$removeparam=param negates the rule with $removeparam=param for any request matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$removeparam=/regexp/ negates the rule with $removeparam=/regexp/ for any request matching ||example.org^. Multiple rules matching a single request In the case when multiple $removeparam rules match a single request, each of them will be applied one by one. Examples $removeparam=/^(utm_source|utm_medium|utm_term)=/ $removeparam=/^(utm_content|utm_campaign|utm_referrer)=/ @@||example.com^$removeparam  With these rules some UTM parameters will be stripped out from any request, except that requests to example.com will not be stripped at all, e.g. http://google.com/page?utm_source=s&amp;utm_referrer=fb.com&amp;utm_content=img will be transformed to http://google.com/page, but http://example.com/page?utm_source=s&amp;utm_referrer=fb.com&amp;utm_content=img will not be affected by the blocking rule. $removeparam=utm_source removes utm_source query parameter from all requests. $removeparam=/utm_.*/ — removes all utm_* query parameters from URL queries of any request, e.g. a request to http://example.com/page?utm_source=test will be transformed to http://example.com/page. $removeparam=/^utm_source=campaign$/ — removes utm_source query parameter with the value equal to campaign. It does not touch other utm_source parameters. Negating one $removeparam rule and replacing it with a different rule $removeparam=/^(gclid|yclid|fbclid)=/ @@||example.com^$removeparam=/^(gclid|yclid|fbclid)=/ ||example.com^$removeparam=/^(yclid|fbclid)=/  With these rules, Google, Yandex, and Facebook Click IDs will be removed from all requests. There is one exception: Google Click ID (gclid) will not be removed from requests to example.com. Negating $removeparam for all parameters $removeparam=/^(utm_source|utm_medium|utm_term)=/ $removeparam=/^(utm_content|utm_campaign|utm_referrer)=/ @@||example.com^$removeparam  With these rules, specified UTM parameters will be removed from any request save for requests to example.org. $removeparam rules can also be disabled by $document and $urlblock exception rules. But basic exception rules without modifiers do not do that. For example, @@||example.com^ will not disable $removeparam=p for requests to example.com, but @@||example.com^$urlblock will. Restrictions Rules with $removeparam modifier can be used only in trusted filters.$removeparam rules are compatible with basic modifiers, content type modifiers, and with $important and $app modifiers. The rules which have any other modifiers are considered invalid and will be discarded. Compatibility Rules with $removeparam modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android and AdGuard Browser Extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.$removeparam syntax for regular expressions is supported by AdGuard Browser Extension v4.0 and AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.8 or later.POST request types are supported only by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. $replace​ This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied, the rule will not block the request. The response is going to be modified instead. You will need some knowledge of regular expressions to use $replace modifier. Features $replace rules apply to any text response, but will not apply to binary (media, image, object, etc).$replace rules do not apply if the size of the original response is more than 3MB.$replace rules have a higher priority than other basic rules (including exception rules). So if a request corresponds to two different rules one of which has the $replace modifier, this rule will be applied.Document-level exception rules with $content or $document modifiers do disable $replace rules for requests matching them.Other document-level exception rules ($generichide, $elemhide or $jsinject modifiers) are applied alongside $replace rules. It means that you can modify the page content with a $replace rule and disable cosmetic rules there at the same time. $replace value can be empty in the case of exception rules. See examples section for further information. Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $replace rules match a single request, we will apply each of them. The order is defined alphabetically. Syntax In general, $replace syntax is similar to replacement with regular expressions in Perl. replace = &quot;/&quot; regexp &quot;/&quot; replacement &quot;/&quot; modifiers  regexp — a regular expression.replacement — a string that will be used to replace the string corresponding to regexp.modifiers — a regular expression flags. For example, i — insensitive search, or s — single-line mode. In the $replace value, two characters must be escaped: comma , and dollar sign $. Use backslash \\ for it. For example, an escaped comma looks like this: \\,. Examples ||example.org^$replace=/(&lt;VAST[\\s\\S]*?&gt;)[\\s\\S]*&lt;\\/VAST&gt;/\\$1&lt;\\/VAST&gt;/i  There are three parts in this rule: regexp - (&lt;VAST(.|\\s)*?&gt;)(.|\\s)*&lt;\\/VAST&gt;;replacement — \\$1&lt;\\/VAST&gt; where $ is escaped;modifiers — i for insensitive search. You can see how this rule works here: http://regexr.com/3cesk Multiple $replace rules ||example.org^$replace=/X/Y/||example.org^$replace=/Z/Y/@@||example.org/page/*$replace=/Z/Y/ Both rule 1 and 2 will be applied to all requests sent to example.org.Rule 2 is disabled for requests matching ||example.org/page/, but rule 1 still works! Disabling $replace rules @@||example.org^$replace will disable all $replace rules matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$content will disable all $replace rules originated from pages of example.org including the page itself. Limitations Rules with $replace modifier can be used only in trusted filters. Compatibility Rules with $replace modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android and AdGuard Browser Extension for Firefox. Such rules do not work in extensions for other browsers because they are unable to modify content on the network level. noop​ noop modifier does nothing and can be used solely to increase rules' readability. It consists of a sequence of underscore characters (_) of any length and can appear in a rule as many times as needed. Examples ||example.com$_,removeparam=/^ss\\\\$/,_,image ||example.com$replace=/bad/good/,___,~third-party  Compatibility Rules with noop modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $empty (deprecated)​ Deprecation notice This modifier is deprecated in favor of the $redirect modifier. Rules with $empty are converting into $redirect=nooptext now. Usually, blocked requests look like a server error to browser. If you use $empty modifier, AdGuard will emulate a blank response from the server with200 OK status. Examples ||example.org^$empty returns an empty response to all requests to example.org and all subdomains. Compatibility Rules with $empty modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $mp4 (deprecated)​ Deprecation notice This modifier is deprecated in favor of the $redirect modifier. Rules with $mp4 are converting into $redirect=noopmp4-1s,media now. As a response to blocked request AdGuard returns a short video placeholder. Examples ||example.com/videos/$mp4 blocks all video downloads from ||example.com/videos/* and changes the response to a video placeholder. Compatibility Rules with $mp4 modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. "},{"title":"Rule priorities​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#rule-priorities","content":"Each rule has its own priority, which is necessary when several rules match the request and the filtering engine needs to select one of them. Priority is measured by a positive integer. Collisions When two rules with the same priority match the same request, it depends on the filtering engine implementation which one will be selected. información The concept of rule priorities becomes increasingly important in light of Manifest V3 as the existing rules need to be converted to declarativeNetRequest rules. Priority computation​ To calculate priority, we've categorized modifiers into different groups. These groups are ranked based on their priority, from lowest to highest. A modifier that significantly narrows the scope of a rule adds more weight to its total priority. Conversely, if a rule applies to a broader range of requests, its priority decreases. It's worth noting that there are cases where a single-parameter modifier has a higher priority than multi-parameter ones. For instance, in the case of $domain=example.com|example.org, a rule that includes two domains has a slightly broader effective area than a rule with one specified domain, therefore its priority is lower. The base priority of any rule is 1. If the calculated priority is a floating-point number, it will be rounded up to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the calculated priority. Compatibility The concept of priority has been introduced in tsurlfilter v2.1.0 and CoreLibs v1.13. Before that AdGuard didn't have any special priority computation algorithm and collisions handling could be different depending on AdGuard product and version.AdGuard for iOS, Safari, and AdGuard Content Blocker rely on the browsers implementation and they cannot follow the rules specified here. nota Modifier aliases (1p, 3p, etc) are not included in these categories, however, they are utilized within the engine to compute the rule priority. Basic modifiers, the presence of each adds 1 to the priority​ $app with negated applications using ~,$denyallow,$dnsrewrite,$domain with negated domains using ~,$match-case,$method with negated methods using ~,$third-party,$to,restricted content-types with ~. When dealing with a negated domain, app, method, or content-type, we add 1 point for the existence of the modifier itself, regardless of the quantity of negated domains or content-types. This is because the rule's scope is already infinitely broad. Put simply, by prohibiting multiple domains, content-types, methods or apps, the scope of the rule becomes only minimally smaller. Defined content-type modifiers, defined methods, defined headers, $popup, special exceptions​ All allowed content types: $document, $font, $image, $media, $object, $other, $ping, $script, $stylesheet, $subdocument, $websocket, $xmlhttprequest; This also includes rules that implicitly add the modifier $document: $popup; Or special exceptions that implicitly add $document,subdocument: $content,$elemhide,$extension,$genericblock,$generichide,$jsinject,$specifichide,$urlblock; Or allowed methods via $method. Or rules with $header. The presence of any content-type modifiers adds (50 + 50 / N), where N is the number of modifiers present, for example: ||example.com^$image,script will add 50 + 50 / 2 = 50 + 25 = 75 to the total weight of the rule. The $popup also belongs to this category, because it implicitly adds the modifier $document. Similarly, specific exceptions add $document,subdocument. If there is a $method modifier in the rule with allowed methods it adds (50 + 50 / N), where N is the number of methods allowed, for example: ||example.com^$method=GET|POST|PUT will add 50 + 50 / 3 = 50 + 16.6 = 67 to the total weight of the rule. If there is a $header modifier in the rule it adds 50. $domain or $app with allowed domains or applications​ Specified domains through $domain or specified applications through $app add 100 + 100 / N, where N is the number of modifier values for example: ||example.com^$domain=example.com|example.org|example.net will add 100 + 100 / 3 = 134.3 = 135 or ||example.com^$app=org.example.app1|org.example.app2 will add 100 + 100 / 2 = 151 or ||example.com^$domain=example.com,app=org.example.app1|org.example.app2 will add 100 + 100/1 ($domain part) and 100 + 100/2 ($app part) - will add 350 in total. Modifier values that are regexps or tld will be interpreted as normal entries of the form example.com and counted one by one, for example: ||example.com^$domain=example.* will add 100 + 100 / 1 = 200 or ||example.com^$domain=example.*|adguard.* will add 100 + 100 / 2 = 150. $redirect rules​ $redirect,$redirect-rule. Each of which adds 10^3 to rule priority. Specific exceptions​ $content,$elemhide,$extension,$genericblock,$generichide,$jsinject,$specifichide,$urlblock; Each of which adds 10^4 to the priority. As well as exception with $document modifier: because it's an alias for $elemhide,content,jsinject,urlblock,extension. It will add 10^4 for each modifier from the top list, 10^4 * 5 in total. In addition, each of these exceptions implicitly adds the two allowed content-type modifiers $document,subdocument. Allowlist rules​ Modifier @@ adds 10^5 to rule priority. $important rules​ Modifier $important adds 10^6 to rule priority. Rules for which there is no priority weight​ Other modifiers, which are supposed to perform additional post- or pre-processing of requests, do not add anything to the rules priority. nota The $replace modifier takes precedence over all blocking rules of categories 1-3, as well as exception rules from categories 3-5, except $content, because an exception with the $content modifier overrides all $replace rules. Examples​ Example 1 ||example.com^ Weight of the rule without modifiers: 1. Example 2 ||example.com^$match-case Weight of the rule: base weight + weight of the modifier from category 1: 1 + 1 = 2.

Non-basic rules However, the capabilities of the basic rules may not be sufficient to block ads. Sometimes you need to hide an element or change part of the HTML code of a web page without breaking anything. The rules described in this section are created specifically for this purpose.

"},{"title":"Element hiding rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#cosmetic-elemhide-rules","content":"Element hiding rules are used to hide the elements of web pages. It is similar to applying { display: none; } style to selected element. Element hiding rules may operate differently depending on the platform. Syntax​  rule = [domains] &quot;##&quot; selector domains = [domain0, domain1[, ...[, domainN]]]  selector — CSS selector, defines the elements to be hidden.domains — domain restriction for the rule. If you want to limit the rule application area to certain domains, just enter them separated with commas. For example: example.org,example.com##selector. This rule will be also applied to all subdomains of example.org and example.com. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain domains, start a domain name with ~ sign. For example: ~example.org##selector. You can use both approaches in a single rule. For example, example.org,~subdomain.example.org##domain will work for example.org and all subdomains, except subdomain.example.org. nota Element hiding rules are not dependent on each other. If there is a rule example.org##selector in the filter and you add ~example.org##selector both rules will be applied independently. Examples example.com##div.textad — hides a div with a class textad at example.com and all subdomains.example.com,example.org###adblock — hides an element with attribute id equals adblock at example.com, example.org and all subdomains.~example.com##.textad — hides an element with a class textad at all domains, except example.com and its subdomains. Limitations Safari does not support both permitted and restricted domains. So the rules like example.org,~foo.example.org##.textad are invalid in AdGuard for Safari. Exceptions Exceptions can disable some rules on particular domains. They are very similar to usual exception rules, but instead of ## you have to use #@#. For example, there is a rule in filter: ##.textad  If you want to disable it for example.com, you can create an exception rule: example.com#@#.textad  Sometimes, it may be necessary to disable all restriction rules. For example, to conduct tests. To do this, use the exclusion rule without specifying a domain. It will completely disable matching CSS elemhide rule on ALL domains: #@#.textad  The same can be achieved by adding this rule: *#@#.textad  We recommend to use this kind of exceptions only if it is not possible to change the hiding rule itself. In other cases it is better to change the original rule, using domain restrictions. "},{"title":"CSS rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#cosmetic-css-rules","content":"Sometimes, simple hiding of an element is not enough to deal with advertising. For example, blocking an advertising element can just break the page layout. In this case AdGuard can use rules that are much more flexible than hiding rules. With this rules you can basically add any CSS styles to the page. Syntax  rule = [domains] &quot;#$#&quot; selector &quot;{&quot; style &quot;}&quot; domains = [domain0, domain1[, ...[, domainN]]]  selector — CSS selector, that defines the elements we want to apply the style to.domains — domain restriction for the rule.

Examples example.com#$#body { background-color: #333!important; }  This rule will apply a style background-color: #333!important; to the body element at example.com and all subdomains. Exceptions Just like with element hiding, there is a type of rules that disable the selected CSS style rule for particular domains. Exception rules syntax is almost the same, you just have to change #$# to #@$#. For example, there is a rule in filter: #$#.textad { visibility: hidden; }  If you want to disable it for example.com, you can create an exception rule: example.com#@$#.textad { visibility: hidden; }  We recommend to use this kind of exceptions only if it is not possible to change the CSS rule itself. In other cases it is better to change the original rule, using domain restrictions. Restrictions Styles that lead to loading any resource are forbidden.

To solve this problem AdGuard extends CSS capabilities by adding support for the new pseudo-elements. We have developed a separate open-source library for non-standard element selecting and applying CSS styles with extended properties. The idea of extended capabilities is an opportunity to match DOM elements with selectors based on their own representation (style, text content, etc.) or relations with other elements. There is also an opportunity to apply styles with non-standard CSS properties. Application area Extended selectors can be used in any cosmetic rule, whether they are element hiding rules or CSS rules. Compatibility Rules with extended CSS selectors are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. Syntax Regardless of the CSS pseudo-classes you are using in the rule, you can use special markers to force applying these rules by ExtendedCss. It is recommended to use these markers for all extended CSS cosmetic rules so that it was easier to find them. The syntax for extended CSS rules: #?# — for element hiding, #@?# — for exceptions#$?# — for CSS rules, #@$?# — for exceptions We strongly recommend using these markers any time when you use an extended CSS selector. Examples example.org#?#div:has(&gt; a[target=&quot;_blank&quot;][rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;]) — this rule blocks all div elements containing a child node that has a link with the attributes [target=&quot;_blank&quot;][rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;]. The rule applies only to example.org and its subdomains.example.com#$?#h3:contains(cookies) { display: none!important; } — this rule sets the style display: none!important to all h3 elements that contain the word cookies. The rule applies only to example.com and all its subdomains.example.net#?#.banner:matches-css(width: 360px) — this rule blocks all .banner elements with the style property width: 360px. The rule applies only to example.net and its subdomains.example.net#@?#.banner:matches-css(width: 360px) — this rule will disable the previous rule. You can apply standard CSS selectors using the ExtendedCss library by using a rule marker #?#, e.g. #?#div.banner. Learn more about how to debug extended selectors. nota Some pseudo-classes do not require selector before it. Still adding a universal selector * makes an extended selector easier to read, even though it has no effect on the matching behavior. So selector #block :has(&gt; .inner) works exactly like #block *:has(&gt; .inner) but second one is more obvious. Pseudo-class names are case-insensitive, e.g. :HAS() works as :has(). Still the lower-case names are used commonly. ExtendedCss Limitations​ CSS comments and at-rules are not supported. Specific pseudo-class may have its own limitations: :has(), :xpath(), :nth-ancestor(), :upward(), :is(), :not(), and :remove(). Pseudo-class :has()​ Draft CSS 4.0 specification describes the :has() pseudo-class. Unfortunately, it is not yet supported by all popular browsers. nota Rules with the :has() pseudo-class should use the native implementation of :has() if they use ## marker and if it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying of ExtendedCss rules with :has(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. Compatibility with other pseudo-classes Synonyms :-abp-has() is supported by ExtendedCss for better compatibility. Deprecation notice :if() is no longer supported as a synonym for :has(). Syntax [target]:has(selector)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementselector — required, standard or extended CSS selector The pseudo-class :has() selects the target elements that fit to the selector. Also the selector can start with a combinator. A selector list can be set in selector as well. In this case all selectors in the list are being matched for now. In the future it will be fixed for &lt;forgiving-relative-selector-list&gt; as argument. :has() limitations​ Usage of the :has() pseudo-class is restricted for some cases (2, 3): disallow :has() inside the pseudos accepting only compound selectors;disallow :has() after regular pseudo-elements. Native :has() pseudo-class does not allow :has(), :is(), :where() inside :has() argument to avoid increasing the :has() invalidation complexity (case 1). But ExtendedCss did not have such limitation earlier and filter lists already contain such rules, so we have not added this limitation to ExtendedCss and allow to use :has() inside :has() as it was possible before. To use it, just force ExtendedCss usage by setting #?#/#$?# rule marker. Native implementation does not allow any usage of :scope inside :has() argument ([1], [2]). Still, there are some such rules in filter lists: div:has(:scope a) which we continue to support by simply converting them to div:has(&gt; a), as it used to be done previously. Examples div:has(.banner) selects all div elements which include an element with the banner class: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected &lt;span class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;inner element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  div:has(&gt; .banner) selects all div elements which include an banner class element as a direct child of div: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;child element&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  div:has(+ .banner) selects all div elements preceding banner class element which immediately follows the div and both are children of the same parent: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;adjacent sibling&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Not selected&lt;/span&gt;  div:has(~ .banner) selects all div elements preceding banner class element which follows the div but not necessarily immediately and both are children of the same parent: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span&gt;Not selected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;general sibling&lt;/p&gt;  div:has(span, .banner) selects all div elements which include both span element and banner class element: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected &lt;span&gt;child span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;child .banner&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :has() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :contains()​ The :contains() pseudo-class principle is very simple: it allows to select the elements that contain specified text or which content matches a specified regular expression. Regexp flags are supported. nota The :contains() pseudo-class uses the textContent element property for matching, not the innerHTML. Compatibility with other pseudo-classes Synonyms :-abp-contains() and :has-text() are supported for better compatibility. Syntax [target]:contains(match)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementmatch — required, string or regular expression for matching element textContent. Regular expression flags are supported. Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;match&quot;&gt;Selected as IT contains &quot;banner&quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected &lt;div class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  the element div#match can be selected by any on these extended selectors: ! plain text div:contains(banner) ! regular expression div:contains(/as .* banner/) ! regular expression with flags div:contains(/it .* banner/gi)  nota Only the div with id=match is selected because the next element does not contain any text, and banner is a part of code, not a text. Old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :contains() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :matches-css()​ The :matches-css() pseudo-class allows to match the element by its current style properties. The work of the pseudo-class is based on using the Window.getComputedStyle() method. Syntax [target]:matches-css([pseudo-element, ] property: pattern)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementpseudo-element — optional, valid standard pseudo-element, e.g. before, after, first-line, etc.property — required, a name of CSS property to check the element forpattern — required, a value pattern that is using the same simple wildcard matching as in the basic url filtering rules OR a regular expression. For this type of matching, AdGuard always does matching in a case-insensitive manner. In the case of a regular expression, the pattern looks like /regexp/. Special characters escaping and unescaping For non-regexp patterns (,),[,] must be unescaped, e.g. :matches-css(background-image:url(data:*)). For regexp patterns \\ should be escaped, e.g. :matches-css(background-image: /^url\\\\(&quot;data:image\\\\/gif;base64.+/). Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; #matched::before { content: &quot;Block me&quot; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;matched&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;not-matched&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  the div elements with pseudo-element ::before and with specified content property can be selected by any of these extended selectors: ! string pattern div:matches-css(before, content: block me) ! string pattern with wildcard div:matches-css(before, content: block*) ! regular expression pattern div:matches-css(before, content: /block me/)  Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Compatibility Obsolete pseudo-classes :matches-css-before() and :matches-css-after() are no longer recommended but still are supported for better compatibility. Old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :matches-css() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :matches-attr()​ The :matches-attr() pseudo-class allows to select an element by its attributes, especially if they are randomized. Syntax [target]:matches-attr(&quot;name&quot;[=&quot;value&quot;])  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementname — required, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for attribute name matchingvalue — optional, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for attribute value matching Escaping special characters For regexp patterns &quot; and \\ should be escaped, e.g. div:matches-attr(class=/[\\\\w]{5}/). Examples div:matches-attr(&quot;ad-link&quot;) selects the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; ad-link=&quot;1random23-banner_240x400&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  div:matches-attr(&quot;data-*&quot;=&quot;adBanner&quot;) selects the element div#target2: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot; data-1random23=&quot;adBanner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  div:matches-attr(*unit*=/^click$/) selects the element div#target3: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target3&quot; random123-unit094=&quot;click&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  *:matches-attr(&quot;/.{5,}delay$/&quot;=&quot;/^[0-9]*$/&quot;) selects the element #target4: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;inner-random23 id=&quot;target4&quot; nt4f5be90delay=&quot;1000&quot;&gt;&lt;/inner-random23&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Pseudo-class :matches-property()​ The :matches-property() pseudo-class allows to select an element by matching its properties. Syntax [target]:matches-property(&quot;name&quot;[=&quot;value&quot;])  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementname — required, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for element property name matchingvalue — optional, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for element property value matching Escaping special characters For regexp patterns &quot; and \\ should be escaped, e.g. div:matches-property(prop=/[\\\\w]{4}/). nota Regexp patterns are supported in name for any property in chain, e.g. prop./^unit[\\\\d]{4}$/.type. Examples An element with such properties: divProperties = { id: 1, check: { track: true, unit_2random1: true, }, memoizedProps: { key: null, tag: 12, _owner: { effectTag: 1, src: 'ad.com', }, }, };  can be selected by any of these extended selectors: div:matches-property(check.track) div:matches-property(&quot;check./^unit_.{4,8}$/&quot;) div:matches-property(&quot;check.unit_*&quot;=true) div:matches-property(memoizedProps.key=&quot;null&quot;) div:matches-property(memoizedProps._owner.src=/ad/)  For filters maintainers To check properties of a specific element, do the following: Inspect the page element or select it in Elements tab of browser DevTools.Run console.dir($0) in Console tab. Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Pseudo-class :xpath()​ The :xpath() pseudo-class allows to select an element by evaluating an XPath expression. Syntax [target]:xpath(expression)  target- optional, standard or extended CSS selectorexpression — required, valid XPath expression :xpath() limitations​ target can be omitted so it is optional. For any other pseudo-class that would mean &quot;apply to all DOM nodes&quot;, but in case of :xpath() it just means &quot;apply to the whole document&quot;, and such applying slows elements selecting significantly. That's why rules like #?#:xpath(expression) are limited to looking inside the body tag. For example, rule #?#:xpath(//div[@data-st-area=\\'Advert\\']) is parsed as #?#body:xpath(//div[@data-st-area=\\'Advert\\']). Extended selectors with defined target as any selector — *:xpath(expression) — can still be used but it is not recommended, so target should be specified instead. Works properly only at the end of selector, except for pseudo-class :remove(). Examples :xpath(//*[@class=&quot;banner&quot;]) selects the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  :xpath(//*[@class=&quot;inner&quot;]/..) selects the element div#target2: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Pseudo-class :nth-ancestor()​ The :nth-ancestor() pseudo-class allows to lookup the nth ancestor relative to the previously selected element. subject:nth-ancestor(n)  subject — required, standard or extended CSS selectorn — required, number &gt;= 1 and &lt; 256, distance to the needed ancestor from the element selected by subject Syntax subject:nth-ancestor(n)  subject — required, standard or extended CSS selectorn — required, number &gt;= 1 and &lt; 256, distance to the needed ancestor from the element selected by subject :nth-ancestor() limitations​ The :nth-ancestor() pseudo-class is not supported inside the argument of the :not() pseudo-class. Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  .child:nth-ancestor(1) selects the element div#target1, div[class=&quot;inner&quot;]:nth-ancestor(3) selects the element div#target2. Pseudo-class :upward()​ The :upward() pseudo-class allows to lookup the ancestor relative to the previously selected element. Syntax subject:upward(ancestor)  subject — required, standard or extended CSS selectorancestor — required, specification for the ancestor of the element selected by subject, can be set as: number &gt;= 1 and &lt; 256 for distance to the needed ancestor, same as :nth-ancestor()standard CSS selector for matching closest ancestor :upward() limitations​ The :upward() pseudo-class is not supported inside the argument of the :not() pseudo-class. Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; data=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  .inner:upward(div[data]) selects the element div#target1, .inner:upward(div[id]) selects the element div#target2, .child:upward(1) selects the element div#target1, .inner:upward(3) selects the element div#target2. Pseudo-class :remove() and pseudo-property remove​ Sometimes, it is necessary to remove a matching element instead of hiding it or applying custom styles. In order to do it, you can use the :remove() pseudo-class as well as the remove pseudo-property. Pseudo-class :remove() can be placed only at the end of a selector. Syntax ! pseudo-class selector:remove() ! pseudo-property selector { remove: true; }  selector — required, standard or extended CSS selector :remove() and remove limitations​ The :remove() pseudo-class is limited to work properly only at the end of selector. For applying the :remove() pseudo-class to any element, a universal selector * should be used. Otherwise such extended selector may be considered as invalid, e.g. .banner &gt; :remove() is not valid for removing any child element of banner class element, so it should look like .banner &gt; *:remove(). If the :remove() pseudo-class or the remove pseudo-property is used, all style properties are ignored except for the debug pseudo-property. Examples div.banner:remove() div:has(&gt; div[ad-attr]):remove() div:contains(advertisement) { remove: true; } div[class]:has(&gt; a &gt; img) { remove: true; }  nota Rules with the remove pseudo-property should use #$?# marker: $ for CSS style rules syntax, ? for ExtendedCss syntax. Pseudo-class :is()​ The :is() pseudo-class allows to match any element that can be selected by any of selectors passed to it. Invalid selectors are skipped and the pseudo-class deals with valid ones with no error thrown. Our implementation of the native :is() pseudo-class. Syntax [target]:is(selectors)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementselectors — forgiving selector list of standard or extended selectors. For extended selectors only compound selectors are supported, not complex. :is() limitations​ Rules with the :is() pseudo-class should use the native implementation of :is() if rules use ## marker and it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying ExtendedCss rules with :is(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. If the :is() pseudo-class argument selectors is an extended selector, due to the way how the :is() pseudo-class is implemented in ExtendedCss v2.0, it is impossible to apply it to the top DOM node which is html, i.e. #?#html:is(&lt;extended-selectors&gt;) does not work. So if target is not defined or defined as a universal selector *, the extended pseudo-class applying is limited to html's children, e.g. rules #?#:is(...) and #?#*:is(...) are parsed as #?#html *:is(...). Please note that there is no such limitation for a standard selector argument, i.e. #?#html:is(.locked) works fine. Complex selectors with extended pseudo-classes are not supported as selectors argument for :is() pseudo-class, only compound ones are allowed. Check examples below for more details. Examples #container *:is(.inner, .footer) selects only the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt; &lt;div data=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Due to limitations :is(*:not([class]) &gt; .banner)' does not work but :is(*:not([class]):has(&gt; .banner)) can be used instead of it to select the element div#target2: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;span&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;inner paragraph&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Pseudo-class :not()​ The :not() pseudo-class allows to select elements which are not matched by selectors passed as argument. Invalid argument selectors are not allowed and error is to be thrown. Our implementation of the :not() pseudo-class. Syntax [target]:not(selectors)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementselectors — list of standard or extended selectors :not() limitations​ Rules with the :not() pseudo-class should use the native implementation of :not() if rules use ## marker and it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying ExtendedCss rules with :not(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. If the :not() pseudo-class argument selectors is an extended selector, due to the way how the :not() pseudo-class is implemented in ExtendedCss v2.0, it is impossible to apply it to the top DOM node which is html, i.e. #?#html:not(&lt;extended-selectors&gt;) does not work. So if target is not defined or defined as a universal selector *, the extended pseudo-class applying is limited to html's children, e.g. rules #?#:not(...) and #?#*:not(...) are parsed as #?#html *:not(...). Please note that there is no such limitation for a standard selector argument, i.e. #?#html:not(.locked) works fine. The :not() is considered as a standard CSS pseudo-class inside the argument of the :upward() pseudo-class because :upward() supports only standard selectors. &quot;Up-looking&quot; pseudo-classes which are :nth-ancestor() and :upward() are not supported inside selectors argument for :not() pseudo-class. Examples #container &gt; *:not(h2, .text) selects only the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Header&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Pseudo-class :if-not() (deprecated)​ Deprecation notice The :if-not() pseudo-class is deprecated and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. This pseudo-class was basically a shortcut for :not(:has()). It was supported by ExtendedCss for better compatibility with some filters subscriptions.

In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, we use a stylesheet injected into the page. The priority of cosmetic rules is the same as any other websites' CSS stylesheet. But there is a limitation: element hiding and CSS rules cannot override inline styles. In such cases, it is recommended to use extended selectors or HTML filtering. In AdGuard Browser Extension, the so called &quot;user stylesheets&quot; are used. They have higher priority than even the inline styles. Extended CSS selectors use JavaScript to work and basically add an inline style themselves, therefore they can override any style. "},{"title":"HTML filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#html-filtering-rules","content":"In most cases, the basis and cosmetic rules are enough to filter ads. But sometimes it is necessary to change the HTML-code of the page itself before it is loaded. This is when you need filtering rules for HTML content. They allow to indicate the HTML elements to be cut out before the browser loads the page. Compatibility HTML filtering rules are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard Browser Extension for Firefox. Such rules do not work in extensions for other browsers because they are unable to modify content on network level. Syntax  rule = [domains] &quot;$$&quot; tagName [attributes] domains = [domain0, domain1[, ...[, domainN]]] attributes = &quot;[&quot; name0 = value0 &quot;]&quot; &quot;[&quot; name1 = value2 &quot;]&quot; ... &quot;[&quot; nameN = valueN &quot;]&quot;  tagName — name of the element in lower case, for example, div or script.domains — domain restriction for the rule. Same principles as in element hiding rules syntax.attributes — a list of attributes, that limit the elements selection. name — attribute name, value — substring, that is contained in attribute value. Examples HTML code: &lt;script data-src=&quot;/banner.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  Rule: example.org$$script[data-src=&quot;banner&quot;]  This rule removes all script elements with the attribute data-src containing the substring banner. The rule applies only to example.org and all its subdomains. Special attributes In addition to usual attributes, which value is every element checked for, there is a set of special attributes that change the way a rule works. Below there is a list of these attributes: tag-content This is the most frequently used special attribute. It limits selection with those elements whose innerHTML code contains the specified substring. You should use &quot;&quot; to escape &quot;, for instance: $$script[tag-content=&quot;alert(&quot;&quot;this is ad&quot;&quot;)&quot;] For example, take a look at this HTML code: &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; document.write('&lt;div&gt;banner text&lt;/div&gt;&quot; /&gt;'); &lt;/script&gt;  Following rule will delete all script elements with a banner substring in their code: $$script[tag-content=&quot;banner&quot;]  Nested elements If we are dealing with multiple nested elements and they all fall within the same HTML filtering rule, they all are going to be deleted. wildcard This special attribute works almost like tag-content and allows you to check the innerHTML code of the document. Rule will check if HTML code of the element fits to the search pattern. You should use &quot;&quot; to escape &quot;, for instance: $$script[wildcard=&quot;&quot;banner&quot;&quot;] For example: $$script[wildcard=&quot;*banner*text*&quot;] It will check, if the code of element contains two consecutive substrings banner and text. max-length Specifies the maximum length for content of HTML element. If this parameter is set and the content length exceeds the value, a rule does not apply to the element. Default value If this parameter is not specified, the max-length is considered to be 8192. For example: $$div[tag-content=&quot;banner&quot;][max-length=&quot;400&quot;]  This rule will remove all the div elements, whose code contains the substring banner and the length of which does not exceed 400 characters. min-length Specifies the minimum length for content of HTML element. If this parameter is set and the content length is less than preset value, a rule does not apply to the element. For example: $$div[tag-content=&quot;banner&quot;][min-length=&quot;400&quot;]  This rule will remove all the div elements, whose code contains the substring banner and the length of which exceeds 400 characters. Exceptions Similar to hiding rules, there is a special type of rules that disable the selected HTML filtering rule for particular domains. The syntax is the same, you just have to change $$ to $@$. For example, there is a rule in filter: $$script[tag-content=&quot;banner&quot;]  If you want to disable it for example.com, you can create an exception rule: example.com$@$script[tag-content=&quot;banner&quot;]  Sometimes, it may be necessary to disable all restriction rules. For example, to conduct tests. To do this, use the exclusion rule without specifying a domain. $@$script[tag-content=&quot;banner&quot;]  We recommend to use this kind of exceptions only if it is not possible to change the hiding rule itself. In other cases it is better to change the original rule, using domain restrictions.

Syntax rule = &quot;[$&quot; modifiers &quot;]&quot; [rule text] modifiers = modifier0[, modifier1[, ...[, modifierN]]]  modifier — set of the modifiers described below.rule text — a rule to be modified. For example, [$domain=example.com,app=test_app]##selector. In the modifiers values of the following characters must be escaped: [, ], ,, and \\ (unless it is used for the escaping). Use \\ to escape them. For example, an escaped bracket looks like this: \\]. $app​ $app modifier lets you narrow the rule coverage down to a specific application or a list of applications. The modifier's behavior and syntax perfectly match the corresponding basic rules $app modifier. Examples [$app=org.example.app]example.com##.textad hides a div with a class textad at example.com and all subdomains in requests sent from the org.example.app Android app.[$app=~org.example.app1|~org.example.app2]example.com##.textad hides a div with a class textad at example.com and all subdomains in requests sent from any app except org.example.app1 and org.example.app2.[$app=com.apple.Safari]example.org#%#//scriptlet('prevent-setInterval', 'check', '!300') applies scriptlet prevent-setInterval only in Safari browser on Mac.[$app=org.example.app]#@#.textad disables all ##.textad rules for all domains while using org.example.app. Compatibility Such rules with $app modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android. $domain​ $domain modifier limits the rule application area to a list of domains and their subdomains. The modifier's behavior and syntax perfectly match the corresponding basic rules $domain modifier. Examples [$domain=example.com]##.textad — hides a div with a class textad at example.com and all subdomains.[$domain=example.com|example.org]###adblock — hides an element with attribute id equals adblock at example.com, example.org and all subdomains.[$domain=~example.com]##.textad — this rule hides div elements of the class textad for all domains, except example.com and its subdomains. Please note that there are 2 ways to specify domain restrictions for non-basic rules: the &quot;classic&quot; way is to specify domains before rule mask and attributes: example.com##.textad;the modifier approach is to specify domains via $domain modifier: [$domain=example.com]##.textad. But rules with mixed style domains restriction are considered invalid. So, for example, the rule [$domain=example.org]example.com##.textad will be rejected. Compatibility Such rules with $domain modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard Browser Extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge. $path​ $path modifier limits the rule application area to specific locations or pages on websites. Syntax $path [&quot;=&quot; pattern]  pattern — optional, a path mask to which the rule is restricted. Its syntax and behavior are pretty much the same as with the pattern for basic rules. You can also use special characters, except for ||, which does not make any sense in this case (see examples below).

Preprocessor directives can be used in the user rules or in the custom filters. Including a file​ The !#include directive allows to include contents of a specified file into the filter. It supports only files from the same origin to make sure that the filter maintainer is in control of the specified file. The included file can also contain pre- directives (even other !#include directives). Ad blockers should consider the case of recursive !#include and implement a protection mechanism. Syntax !#include file_path  where file_path is a same origin absolute or relative file path to be included. The files must originate from the same domain but may be located in a different folder. If included file is not found or unavailable, the whole filter update should fail. Same-origin limitation should be disabled for local custom filters.

Valid (relative path): !#include /includedfile.txt !#include ../path2/includedfile.txt ! ! Invalid (another origin): !#include https://domain.com/path/includedfile.txt  Conditions​ Filters maintainers can use conditions to supply different rules depending on the ad blocker type. When an adblocker encounters an !#if directive, followed eventually by an !#endif directive, it will compile the code inside of the directives block only if the specified condition is true. Condition supports all the basic logical operators. A conditional directive beginning with an !#if directive must explicitly be terminated with an !#endif directive. Whitespaces matter. !#if is a valid directive, while !# if is not. Syntax !#if (conditions) rules_list !#endif  where: !#if (conditions) — start of the blockconditions — just like in some popular programming languages, preprocessor conditions are based on constants declared by ad blockers.

But in AdGuard for Safari and AdGuard for iOS max rule count is raised to 300k by splitting them into several content blockers. Generally, several filters categories are more or less independent, so there is such content blockers with such categories included: AdGuard General — Ad Blocking, Language-specificAdGuard Privacy — PrivacyAdGuard Social — Social Widgets, AnnoyancesAdGuard Security — SecurityAdGuard Other — OtherAdGuard Custom — Custom User rules and Allowlist are added to every content blocker. The main issue with using multiple content blockers is that rules inside these content blockers cannot influence each other. This may lead to different unexpected issues. So filters maintainers may use !#safari_cb_affinity to define Safari content blockers affinity for the rules inside of the directive block. Syntax !#safari_cb_affinity(content_blockers) rules_list !#safari_cb_affinity  where: !#safari_cb_affinity(content_blockers) — start of the blockcontent_blockers — comma-separated list of content blockers.

Windows captura toda la pantalla y la copia en el portapapeles (invisible). Para hacer una captura de pantalla de una ventana activa, utiliza la siguiente combinación: Manten presionado Alt y pulsa PrtScn (o Fn + Alt + PrtScn en algunos portátiles) Para tomar una captura de pantalla de un área específica, debes utilizar la siguiente combinación: Manten presionado Win (el botón de Windows) y Shift y presiona S** Después de tomar una captura de pantalla, se guardará en el portapapeles. En la mayoría de los casos, podrás pegarla en un documento que estés editando en ese momento utilizando la combinación de botones Ctrl + V. Alternativamente, si necesitas guardar la captura de pantalla en un archivo, debes abrir el programa estándar Paint (o cualquier otra aplicación que pueda trabajar con imágenes). Pega tu captura de pantalla allí utilizando la misma combinación de botones o haciendo clic en el botón Pegar (normalmente en la esquina superior izquierda de la pantalla) y luego guárdala. Windows 8 y 10 permite hacer una captura de pantalla muy rápidamente con la combinación Win + PrtScn. Tan pronto como presiones estos botones, la captura de pantalla se guardará automáticamente como un archivo en tu carpeta de Imágenes → Capturas de pantalla. También hay un programa dedicado a tomar capturas de pantalla llamado Snipping Tool, que se puede encontrar a través del menú de Inicio entre los programas estándar de tu ordenador. La Snipping Tool te permite capturar cualquier área de tu escritorio o toda la pantalla. Después de tomar una captura de pantalla con este programa, puedes editar la imagen y guardarla en cualquier carpeta de tu ordenador. Además, también puedes probar a utilizar diferentes aplicaciones para hacer capturas de pantalla en tu ordenador, como PicPick, Nimbus Screenshot, Screenshot Captor, Snipaste, Monosnap, etc. "},{"title":"macOS​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to take a screenshot","url":"guides/take-screenshot/#mac","content":"Para hacer una captura de pantalla en Mac, utiliza la siguiente combinación de botones: Manten pulsado ⌘ Cmd + Shift + 3** Tu Mac capturará toda la pantalla y la guardará como un archivo en el escritorio.

Una vez que abras nuestra página en Crowdin, elige cualquier proyecto que necesites y selecciona tu idioma. También podrás cambiar de idioma incluso después de abrir determinadas carpetas de productos. Elige cualquiera de las carpetas de productos disponibles y selecciona un archivo; ahora puedes comenzar a traducir. Nota: también puedes cambiar el idioma de la interfaz de Crowdin haciendo clic en el botón Configuración en la esquina superior derecha de la página. En la ventana abierta, desplázate hacia abajo hasta la pestaña UI language. Ábrela, elige un idioma y haz clic en Cambiar. Las siguientes directrices te ayudarán en el proceso. Puedes filtrar las traducciones haciendo clic en este botón y seleccionando cualquier opción ofrecida. Desplázate fácilmente entre los archivos del proyecto. Presta atención a los términos del glosario resaltados con una línea de puntos en una frase fuente. Por lo general, son palabras especiales (como nombres de marcas) que no deben traducirse. Puedes sugerir tu traducción para términos traducibles en el proyecto Glosario de AdGuard. En Crowdin, las strings pueden tener notas que facilitan la comprensión y traducción de frases. Búscalas en el campo &quot;Contexto&quot; de la string de origen. Presta atención también a las capturas de pantalla que suelen acompañar a las frases de origen en el campo &quot;Contexto&quot;. Ayudan a comprender el contexto y transmiten el significado exacto. Ten en cuenta que puedes solicitar contexto haciendo clic en el botón &quot;SOLICITUD&quot;. Además de sugerir nuevas traducciones, también puedes dejar comentarios en las strings. Usa los comentarios para informarnos sobre errores en las traducciones existentes, toma notas o haz preguntas. Si ves un comentario sobre tu traducción, intenta responderlo. También hay una pestaña Discusiones en la página principal del proyecto que te permite ver todos los comentarios para el idioma específico en este proyecto. Crowdin proporciona una herramienta muy útil y conveniente llamada Translation Memory. Con su ayuda, puedes encontrar las traducciones realizadas anteriormente de las mismas palabras y frases y reutilizarlas en tus traducciones. Una vez que te unas a un proyecto haciendo clic en el botón &quot;Unirse&quot;, verás la pestaña Tasks en la página del proyecto, donde se crean las tareas para archivos de proyectos específicos. Por favor, préstales atención: suelen tener mayor prioridad. A veces puedes encontrar frases con formas plurales. Presta especial atención al traducir estas frases. Puedes leer cómo traducir formas plurales aquí. El uso de formas plurales adecuadas es extremadamente importante: pregúntanos en los comentarios si algo no está claro. No escribas directamente a los directores de proyecto y correctores que figuran en la información del proyecto. Si tienes alguna duda sobre las traducciones, siempre puedes preguntar a nuestros correctores o administradores a través de los comentarios.

Su uso depende del número de cosas de las que se hable. Por ejemplo, las palabras en inglés tienen dos formas de palabras cuando se habla de algo en singular, como &quot;one star&quot;, y en plural: &quot;two stars&quot;. No importa si dices cinco, veintiséis o incluso quinientas treinta y dos estrellas, la terminación ''s'' seguirá siendo la misma. Pero algunos idiomas pueden contener solo una o varias formas plurales. A diferencia del inglés, el idioma polaco tiene tres formas plurales de sustantivos. Uno de ellos se usa cuando se habla de algo en singular, otra forma se usa en plural pero con números que terminan en 2-4, excluyendo 12-14, y la tercera forma, para palabras con otros números delante de ellos. Veamos esta imagen. Aquí puedes ver los grupos de números que determinan la forma de una palabra cuando se encuentran frente a ella.  Dibujemos un pequeño paralelo entre el inglés y el polaco para una mejor comprensión:  La versión en inglés: Los equivalentes polacos: 1. forma: It takes one hour. 1. forma: Zajmuje a godzinę. 2. form: It takes two hours. 2. forma: Zajmuje a dwie godziny. 3. forma: It takes five hours. 3. forma: Zajmuje a pięć godzin.  Ahora está claro que el polaco 'godzinę' (hora) tiene tres formas diferentes, mientras que la palabra inglesa cambia su forma con números solo dos veces. Además del polaco, hay muchos otros idiomas que tienen tres formas plurales y más, como el ruso, el serbio, el eslovaco, el checo, etc. Pero no todos obedecen a la misma regla. Por eso es tan importante saber cuántas formas plurales contiene tu idioma y cómo puedes aplicarlas. "},{"title":"¿Dónde puedes aprender sobre el número de formas plurales?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Formas plurales","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#where-to-learn","content":"Cuando se enfrenta a una traducción que requiere el uso de plurales, es posible que no puedas darte cuenta de inmediato de cuántas formas de palabras contiene tu idioma. Aquí hay algunas fuentes de información que puedes utilizar. La Guía de localización contiene una amplia lista de idiomas. El número de formas plurales para diferentes idiomas se muestra de esta manera: 'nplurals=2', 'nplurals=4' y así sucesivamente. El número después del signo igual '=' significa el número de formas plurales del idioma respectivo. Además, puedes obtener información sobre formas plurales en el Repositorio de datos de configuración regional común (CLDR) de Unicode. Las reglas CLDR Plural indican una forma de palabra adicional para los números decimales (1,5; 2,3; 100,1…), pero no las usamos en las traducciones de AdGuard.

Actualmente, tenemos 4 tipos de cadenas en Crowdin que implican el uso de plurales. Veámoslos más de cerca. "},{"title":"1.

"},{"title":"2. Cadenas con sustantivos singulares y plurales separados por comas​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Formas plurales","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#2type","content":"Este tipo de cadenas se concentra principalmente en el proyecto AdGuard para Android. Mira el ejemplo:  Si hay 3 formas plurales de sustantivos en tu idioma (como en polaco), escribe todas las formas plurales separadas por comas. hora, horas - godzinę, godziny, godzin En caso de que un sustantivo tenga solo 2 formas, no hay necesidad de escribir la misma forma dos veces (¡normalmentesolo para este tipo de strings con plurales!). Sin embargo, no será un error si repites la forma dos veces. "},{"title":"3. Cadenas que usan el patrón desarrollado por Crowdin​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Formas plurales","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#3type","content":"Este es el esquema más fácil de usar para traducir strings con plurales. Crowdin sugiere a los usuarios que traduzcan cierta cantidad de frases con diferentes formas plurales. Si tu idioma proporciona solo una forma plural, verás solo una frase para traducir. Si hay tres o más formas, Crowdin te proporcionará el string dividida en otras dos o tres cadenas para traducir. Por ejemplo:  Está atento al traducir estas strings y aprobarlas. Si no tienes idea de lo que significa el campo &quot;Other&quot;, simplemente pega el mismo formulario que está en el campo &quot;Many&quot;. Las traducciones de los campos &quot;Many&quot; y &quot;Other&quot; pueden ser las mismas. "},{"title":"4. Strings con plantillas separadas por el signo de la barra vertical​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Formas plurales","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#4type","content":"Este es el tipo más complicado de strings de AdGuard que se usa principalmente en el proyecto AdGuard Websites. Presta mucha atención a un signo de barra vertical entre las oraciones y los placeholders %count% en las frases originales; esto te ayudará a identificar frases donde las traducciones requieren el uso de formas plurales.  Ahora, imaginemos: se enfrentas a una string de este tipo: Licencia estándar para %count% computadora | Licencia estándar para %count% computadores. ¿Qué debes saber para traducirlo correctamente? Llamemos a las oraciones que están divididas por un signo de barra vertical &quot;plantillas&quot;, porque en realidad sirven como plantillas para frases con números diferentes. Volviendo al ejemplo, como el idioma inglés incluye solo dos formas, debería haber dos plantillas respectivamente: Licencia estándar para *%count%* computadora | Licencia estándar para *%count%* computadoras donde plantilla 1 – Licencia estándar para %count% computadora, y plantilla 2 – Licencia estándar para %count% computadoras Otra cosa importante a la que debes prestar atención son los placeholders %count% que, como de costumbre, se colocan antes de las palabras que definen. En lugar de %count% aquí aparecerán diferentes números dependiendo de las plantillas que se elijan. En una situación con otro idioma que tiene, digamos, tres formas plurales, debe haber tres plantillas con dos barras verticales entre ellas. Por ejemplo, cuando traducimos la frase mencionada anteriormente al eslovaco, que de acuerdo con la regla del Guía de localización tiene tres formas de palabras, la traducción correcta se verá así: **Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítač | Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítače | Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítačov**  En este caso, vemos tres plantillas que contienen tres formas de la palabra &quot;počítač&quot; (computadora) en eslovaco. Si ignoramos una de las formas y usamos solo dos plantillas para eslovaco en lugar de tres, el sistema no podrá tomar una plantilla adecuada para ciertos números y, como resultado, tendremos errores gramaticales en las oraciones, como en inglés: Standard license for 5 computer. Always use as many forms as there are in your language, even when the word itself has fewer word forms. Por ejemplo, la palabra serbia 'računar' (computadora) tiene solo dos formas. Pero hay 3 formas plurales en serbio.  Por lo tanto, la traducción del inglés al serbio debería ser: **Standardna licenca za *%count%* računar | Standardna licenca za *%count%* računara | Standardna licenca za *%count%* računara** Aunque es obvio que las dos últimas plantillas no tienen diferencias, es muy importante mantener la regla: El número de plantillas debe reflejar el número de formas plurales del idioma respectivo!(típicamente para este tipo de cadenas con plurales). "},{"title":"Breve resumen​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Formas plurales","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#summury","content":"Al traducir proyectos de AdGuard, presta mucha atención a las frases que requieren el uso de formas plurales. Mientras que los tres primeros tipos de strings de este tipo son más o menos fáciles de ejecutar, el cuarto tipo exige más vigilancia. Y de nuevo: si encuentras una frase original con dos elementos importantes: , el signo de barra vertical y %count% marcadores de posición, haz lo siguiente: Consulta la regla del plural de la lengua a la que traduces; The number of your templates should be consistent with the number of plural forms your language includes, even in cases some words have fewer forms themselves. Two plural forms – two templates in translations; five plural forms – five templates, etc. No olvides usar un signo de barra vertical entre las plantillas tal como se representa en los strings originales; No traduzcas, rellenes ni elimines los placeholders %count% . By following these simple rules you will help AdGuard developers avoid a lot of unnecessary complications during the localization process.

No tenemos pautas claras sobre con qué archivos o productos del proyecto AdGuard Applications comenzar. Simplemente elige cualquier producto que desees. Solo hay un par de cosas que queremos mencionar: Puedes ver la aplicación solo en aquellos idiomas para los que todas las traducciones se completan en Crowdin;Recomendamos traducir las descripciones de las tiendas de aplicaciones en segundo lugar, porque sin la traducción de los productos en sí, las descripciones no serán necesarias. La situación es diferente en el proyecto AdGuard Websites. Se pueden agregar idiomas al sitio incluso si no está disponible un conjunto completo de traducciones. Sin embargo, esto depende de qué archivos ya se han traducido. Es por eso que te recomendamos que comiences con los archivos más importantes, que se enumeran a continuación: Sitio web del bloqueador de anuncios AdGuard critical.resxauth.resxwelcome.resx Sitio web de AdGuard VPN critical.resxauth.resx Sitio web de AdGuard DNS critical.resxauth.resx Adding new strings as well as updating existing ones in these files requires special attention from the project translators and proofreaders. In addition to websites, there is a file for translating transactional emails in the AdGuard Websites project. Newly added strings in this file also have a high translation priority.","keywords":""},{"title":"Actualizando la Base de conocimientos","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/updating-knowledge-base/","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Cómo sugerir un cambio o redactar un nuevo artículo​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Actualizando la Base de conocimientos","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/updating-knowledge-base/#suggest-change","content":"Puedes sugerir cambios a los artículos actuales y agregar otros nuevos a nuestra base de conocimientos utilizando la funcionalidad de GitHub mencionada anteriormente.
