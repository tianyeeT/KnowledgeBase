At the same time, the ad blocking itself was completely under of the desktop app's control, the extension and its settings played no role in that. The problem was, in some cases the app and the extension would hamper each other’s work. Some websites would stop being protected by the desktop program and were backed up only by the extension which has less possibilities. Thus, starting with AdGuard Browser Extension v3.5, the integration mode was removed. Instead, the new AdGuard Browser Assistant was implemented.

"},{"title":"Ad blocking​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-browser-extension/overview/#adblocker","content":"Blocking ads is clearly the key functionality of any ad blocker, and AdGuard is not an exception. The extension will successfully block ads on any page in your browser. Ad blocking is based on so-called filter lists, or simply filters. Filters can be enabled or disabled in your extension's settings. You can customize ad blocking by activating specific filters. "},{"title":"Filters​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-browser-extension/overview/#filters","content":"In essence, filter lists are sets of rules written in a special language. Your ad blocker interpretes the rules and implements them. As a result, you stop seeing ads on your webpages.  All filters are grouped according to their role. For example, there are categories for ad-blocking filters, privacy protection filters, social media-related filters, etc. You can enable either individual filters or the entire group at once.  Custom filters​ While the features of other filter groups are more or less predictable, there is a group called Custom that may raise additional questions.  In this tab, you can add filters that are not present in the extension by default. There are plenty of publicly available filters on the Internet. Moreover, you can create and add your own filters. In fact, you can build any set of filters and customize ad blocking the way you like. To add a filter, just click Add custom filter, enter the URL or the file path of the filter you want to be added and click Next.  "},{"title":"User rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-browser-extension/overview/#user-rules","content":"User rules is another tool that helps you customize the blocking of ads.  There are several ways to add new rules. The most straightforward is to just type a rule in, but it requires some knowledge of the rule syntax. You can import a ready-to-use filter list from a text file as well. Make sure that different rules are separated by line breaks. Note that importing a ready-to-use filter list is better done in the Custom filters tab. Besides, you can export your own filtering rules. This option is good for transferring your list of rules between browsers or devices. When you add a website to the Allowlist (more on that below) or use the Assistant tool for hiding an element on the page, a corresponding rule is also saved in User rules.

Besides, you can submit a complaint about any website (for example, if there are missed ads on the page, our filter engineers will review the report and fix the problem) and see the statistics on applied blocking rules. All web requests made by the browser are displayed in the Filtering log, along with detailed information about each request. The Filtering log makes it easy, for example, to monitor requests blocked by AdGuard Browser Extension. Besides, it allows you to block any request or add a previously blocked request to Allowlist in two clicks. The Filtering log also offers you a wide variety of options for sorting web requests, which can be helpful when creating your own filtering rules. You can open the Filtering log by selecting the corresponding item in the main menu, or from the settings page (in the &quot;Additional settings&quot; tab). By clicking the icons in the top right corner of the extension's main menu, you can open the extension settings or pause the protection. "},{"title":"AdGuard Browser Extension vs. standalone apps​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-browser-extension/overview/#comparison","content":" The main advantage of AdGuard standalone programs over browser extensions is that the programs can block ads in every browser and in almost all apps. You may use different browsers at the same time, the app will filter ads and online threats in all of them equally well. The second difference is that the possibilities of extension-based ad blockers are strictly limited by browser guidelines. The browser extensions have to conform to the policies of the browsers, where ad blocking might be restricted. Thus, some types of filtering rules are not supported by the extensions. The functionality of the desktop apps is not limited, so they have a better filtering quality. Whereas AdGuard Browser Extension is free and easy to install, and has filters to block ads and fight online threats, the full-fledged apps are more powerful and have a list of advanced features. See all the differences in the comparative table below.  1 – within browser restrictions and only in the browser where it is installed; 2 – the extension is unable to detect requests from other extensions. If a malicious or tracking extension sends a request to its server to show you ads or track your activity, AdGuard Browser Extension will not be able to block that request; 3 – not all types of ads and threats can be blocked by browser extensions due to certain browser limitations. Some elements may get to the page and slow down the loading process. Besides, unlike browser-based ad blockers, the AdGuard app blocks ads before they are loaded to the browser. This saves traffic and speeds up page loading.

To protect your entire device, download the AdGuard app AdGuard has two Android apps: AdGuard for Android and AdGuard Content Blocker. AdGuard for Android has a much wider range of functionality: it blocks ads, trackers, and annoyances in browsers and apps, uses filters as well as domain-level ad blocking, and supports user rules. AdGuard Content Blocker has a limited functionality. Full-fledged ad blockers can’t be introduced to Google Play due to the policy of the store. Google Play has banned &quot;apps that block or interfere with another app displaying ads&quot;. Thus, AdGuard for Android can be downloaded on AdGuard's official website only. As an alternative, Google offers to developers the Content blocking API. The API has strict limitations and is currently supported by two browsers: Yandex Browser and Samsung Internet browser. Many complex filtering rules supported in other AdGuard products don't work with this API. AdGuard Content Blocker was designed to fit the Google Play policy framework. Compared to other AdGuard products, AdGuard Content Blocker has less ad blocking capabilities: AdGuard Content Blocker works only in browsers that support the content blocking technology. Currently, there are two: Yandex Browser and Samsung Internet browser.Within the existing technology, the functionality of AdGuard Content Blocker is limited: for example it cannot block ads and trackers in apps or other browsers, has no filtering log and doesn't support filtering at the domain level. However, AdGuard Content Blocker has 35 filters that allow you to block ads, trackers, and annoyances in two supported browsers. You can also customize ad blocking by selecting appropriate language-specific filters or adding user rules. AdGuard Content Blocker is a free open-source software.

Network​ HTTPS filtering​ To block ads and trackers on most websites and in most apps, AdGuard needs to filter their HTTPS traffic. Read more about HTTPS filtering Security certificates​ To manage encrypted traffic, AdGuard installs its CA certificate on your device. It's safe: the traffic is filtered locally and AdGuard verifies the security of the connection. On older versions of Android, the certificate is installed automatically. On Android 11 and later, you need to install it manually. Installation instructions The CA certificate in the user store is enough to filter HTTPS traffic in browsers and some apps. However, there are apps that only trust certificates from the system store. To filter HTTPS traffic there, you need to install AdGuard's CA certificate into the system store. Instructions HTTPS-filtered apps​ This section contains the list of apps for which AdGuard filters HTTPS traffic. Please note that the setting can be applied for all apps only if you have CA certificates both in the user store and in the system store. HTTPS-filtered websites​ This setting allows you to manage websites for which AdGuard should filter HTTPS traffic. HTTPS filtering allows AdGuard to filter the content of requests and responses, but we never collect or store this data. However, to increase security, we exclude websites that contain potentially sensitive information from HTTPS filtering. You can also add websites that you consider necessary to exclusions by selecting one of the modes: Exclude specific websites from HTTPS filteringFilter HTTPS traffic only on the websites added to exclusions By default, we also do not filter websites with Extended Validation (EV) certificates, such as financial websites. If needed, you can enable the Filter websites with EV certificates option. Proxy​ You can set up AdGuard to route all your device's traffic through your proxy server. How to set up an outbound proxy In this section, you can also set up a third-party VPN to work with AdGuard, if your VPN provider allows it. Under Apps operating through proxy, you can select apps that will route their traffic through your specified proxy. If you have Integration with AdGuard VPN enabled, this setting plays the role of AdGuard VPN's app exclusions: it allows you to specify apps to be routed through the AdGuard VPN tunnel. Routing mode​ This section allows you to select the traffic filtering method. Local VPN filters traffic through a locally created VPN. This is the most reliable mode. Due to Android restrictions, it is also the only system-wide traffic filtering method available on non-rooted devices. note The Local VPN mode doesn't allow AdGuard to be used simultaneously with other VPNs. To use another VPN with AdGuard, you need to reconfigure it to work in proxy mode and set up an outbound proxy in AdGuard. For AdGuard VPN, this is done automatically with the help of the Integrated mode. Automatic proxy is an alternative traffic routing method that does not require the use of a VPN. One significant advantage is that it can be run in parallel with a VPN. This mode requires root access. Manual proxy involves setting up a proxy server on a specific port, which can then be configured in Wi-Fi settings. This mode requires root access for Android 10 and above. Filters​ AdGuard blocks ads, trackers, and annoyances by applying rules from its filters. Most features from the Protection section are powered by AdGuard filters. If you enable Basic protection, it will automatically turn on the AdGuard Base filter and AdGuard Mobile Ads filter. And vice versa: if you turn off both filters, Basic protection will also be disabled.  Filters enabled by default are enough for normal AdGuard operation. However, if you want to customize ad blocking, you can use other AdGuard or third-party filters. To do this, select a category and enable the filters you'd like. To add a custom filter, tap Custom filters → Add custom filter and enter its URL or file path. note If you activate too many filters, some websites may work incorrectly. Read more about filters Userscripts​ Userscripts are mini-programs written in JavaScript that extend the functionality of one or more websites. To install a userscripts, you need a special userscript manager. AdGuard has such a functionality and allows you to add userscripts by URL or from file.  AdGuard Extra​ AdGuard Extra is a custom userscript that prevents websites from bypassing ad blockers and re-inserting blocked ads.

Android derives traffic consumption judging on so-called Power Profile, which is given by every manufacturer: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html Main part of Power Profile is a set of values in mAh which define battery consumption for every component of the device: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html For example, from the table above: wifi.active= 31mA additional consumption in mAh caused by WiFi data exchange. radio.active= 100-300mA additional consumption in mAh caused by data exchange over Mobile network. cpu.active= 100-200mA additional consumption in mAh caused by CPU work. AdGuard by itself almost doesn't consume any traffic, so for the sake of evaluating battery resource consumption let's get rid of 'Mobile/WiFi packets' and stcik to 'CPU'. Formula to calculate the consumption: &quot;CPU TIME (ms)&quot; X &quot;cpu.active&quot; / (60 60 1000) = &quot;POWER USE mAh&quot; Let's put real numbers into this formula. Let's take CPU total from the second screenshot and convert into milliseconds: 506000 A coefficient cpu.active for 2GHz will be roughly equal to 225mAh Final result: 506000 225 / (60 60 * 1000) = 31,625mAh "},{"title":"결론​","type":1,"pageTitle":"배터리 및 트래픽 소비 문제","url":"adguard-for-android/solving-problems/battery/#결론","content":"Real consumption is several times less than it is shown in Android statistics.

But starting from version Q, the presence of Private DNS forces apps to redirect traffic through the system resolver instead of AdGuard. See Android devs blog for more details. To solve the problem with Private DNS, use the $network rule Some device manufacturers keep Private DNS settings hidden and set 'Automatic' mode as a default one. Thus, disabling Private DNS is impossible but we can make the system think that the upstream is not valid by blocking it with a $network rule. For instance, if the system uses Google DNS by default, we can add rules |8.8.4.4^$network and |8.8.8.8^$network to block Google DNS.

Selecting Custom DNS allows you to list IPv4 and IPv6 server addresses to use as upstreams. Fallback domains​ Here you can list domains that will be forwarded directly to fallback upstreams if they exist. Detect search domains​ If this setting is enabled, AdGuard will detect search domains and automatically forward them to fallback upstreams. Bootstrap upstreams​ Bootstrap DNS for DoH, DoT, and DoQ servers. The Automatic DNS - the system DNS or AdGuard DNS - is used by default. By selecting Custom DNS, you can list IPv4 and IPv6 server addresses to use as bootstrap upstreams. adblock-style 규칙을 위한 차단 모드​ Here you can specify the response type for domains blocked by DNS rules based on adblock rule syntax (for instance, ||example.org^).

To see how it works, download the AdGuard app To be able to filter HTTPS traffic (which is extremely important as most ads use HTTPS), AdGuard needs to install a certificate into your device's user storage. On older versions of Android OS this was done automatically, but on Android 11 and later users have to install it manually. Follow these steps to install AdGuard certificate: When you see the HTTPS filtering is off notification, tap Enable. Then you'll be presented with three screens that explain: Why filter HTTPS trafficThe safety of this filtering processThe necessity of AdGuard certificate Consecutively tap Next → Next → Save certificate on these screens. Tap Save at the bottom of the opened Download folder. After saving, tap Open Settings, navigate to Encryption &amp; credentials, and then choose Install a certificate. You might see a warning, if so, tap Install anyway. From the list, select the file with AdGuard certificate. You're all set! Once the certificate is installed successfully, you've enabled HTTPS filtering. Please note that the steps provided are based on the Google Pixel 4 smartphone. If you're using a different Android device, the exact menu names or options might vary. For easier navigation consider searching for a certificate by accessing your device's settings and entering &quot;certificate&quot; or &quot;credentials&quot; in the search bar. If you experience issues during the manual certificate installation (for example, you installed the certificate, but the application keeps ignoring it), you can follow one of the solutions below.

To see how it works, download the AdGuard app A number of users have encountered an issue where Samsung Pay does not work while AdGuard is running. This issue occurs almost exclusively on devices registered in South Korea. What is causing this issue? Sometimes Samsung Pay does not work on devices with VPN services running, and AdGuard is one of these apps. By default, AdGuard uses a local VPN to filter traffic, which can cause problems when using Samsung Pay. As a consequence, users had to disable AdGuard when making payments with Samsung Pay. This can be avoided with the Detect Samsung Pay feature. When this option is enabled, the AdGuard app is paused whenever the user opens the Samsung Pay app and resumes when the app is closed. note This feature will work only if the Local VPN filtering mode is chosen in AdGuard settings. If another mode is being used, Samsung Pay will function without any interruptions. To enable Detect Samsung Pay, follow these steps: Go to Settings → General → Advanced→ Low-level settings. Scroll to Detect Samsung Pay and move the slider to the right. Tap Allow permissions and give AdGuard access to information about the use of other apps. We need it to collect statistics about the operation of Samsung Pay in order for the Detect Samsung Pay feature to work. After enabling this feature, when you switch from Samsung Pay to AdGuard, the following message will appear as shown in the screenshot. Alternatively, you can disable filtering for Samsung Pay in App management. Simply go to the App management screen (third tab from the bottom), find Samsung Pay in the list, and turn off the switch at Route traffic through AdGuard.","keywords":""},{"title":"How to set up outbound proxy","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"adguard-for-android/solving-problems/outbound-proxy/","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Proxy configuration examples​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to set up outbound proxy","url":"adguard-for-android/solving-problems/outbound-proxy/#proxy-configuration-examples","content":"In this article we give examples of how to set up some of the most popular proxies to work with AdGuard.

"},{"title":"Filters​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-mac/overview/#filters","content":" Filters are the main driving force behind the Ad blocker module. To understand how filtering works, get acquainted with our comprehensive article. But in essence, filter lists are sets of rules written in a special language, and your ad blocker is an interpreter of these rules who then implements them. As a result, you stop seeing ads on your web pages and life gets lots better. Some filter lists (AdGuard’s Base filter, Annoyances filter, EasyList, etc.) are pre-installed, while other specific ones, adapted to your preferences, can be downloaded additionally and added to your program. Aside from the more general and universally applicable filters (like Base filter), AdGuard provides an extensive quantity of filters for every occasion: filters aimed at tracking prevention (like Tracking Protection filter),language-specific ad filters that block content in a selected language,Social media filter that removes &quot;Like&quot; and &quot;Share&quot; buttons,Annoyances filter for cookie warnings, in-page pop-ups and others of the same ilk,and even a filter that unblocks some ads instead of blocking them — Filter for search ads and self-promotions. AdGuard filters are automatically updated. Our developers create them all based on user feedback received. You can always help other AdGuard users (and yourself, in perspective) by sending us reports right from the app's Assistant (it's really handy, we'll tell you more about the Assistant further on), or from the website. If you wish to know more about AdGuard filters, here is some info.

If you have some coding experience and would like to create your own rules that would be a better custom fit than the standard filters already available, then you can try your hand at this. The syntax AdGuard uses for its filtering rules is based on that of any other ad blocking extension, but with considerable additions, extending its possibilities. The whole process of rule-writing in all its nuances is described in these comprehensive instructions, so if you want to write some custom rules and check how much of a coder you are, just follow the steps we described in this article.

"},{"title":"Browsing Security​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-mac/overview/#browsing-security","content":" Next we have the Security panel, where a module also known as Browsing Security is located. What it does is protection from malicious and phishing websites. note AdGuard is not an antivirus, but an entirely different program. It will show you a warning if you are about to go onto an infected domain, but it cannot stop you from downloading anything suspicious or help you deal with already existing viruses. Phishing is a very common web fraud aimed at stealing personal data (passwords, bank account details, etc.). It is carried out using fake web pages mimicking popular websites or real services, such as web stores or social networks. Many phishing websites have URLs that only differ from the real ones in just a few symbols to put you off your guard. If a user enters their details on such a website, they’ll definitely end up in the wrong hands. Browsing Security gives strong protection against such incidents. At the same time, the user’s personal information is not transferred anywhere, and AdGuard servers do not know which websites the user is visiting, because the security check is not performed via open web address (URL) but through hash prefixes (hash is a certain data structure that renders each address added to the base unambiguous). Some web pages are not malicious themselves, but they may contain elements built into their structure by other websites. Unlike browser plug-ins, Browsing Security module checks each object built into any web page, ensuring maximum protection. If you wish to help us in perfecting this module, you can check the lower box on the panel near the &quot;Help us with Browsing Security filters development&quot; phrase. This will enable your computer to send us pertinent info on fraudulent websites you might stumble upon while surfing the web — and our developers will make sure they end up locked at the bottom of your ban list. "},{"title":"Browser Assistant​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-mac/overview/#browser-assistant","content":" AdGuard Browser Assistant’s primary function is to manage filtering directly from the browser. It used to be a mere userscript incorporated into AdGuard for Mac app that then became a full-fledged browser extension. Know more about the benefits it yields.  You will be prompted to install the Browser Assistant for your default browser when you first install AdGuard (during the onboarding process). If you missed it, you can download it for any browser at any time. "},{"title":"Extensions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-mac/overview/#extensions","content":" Extensions are small programs that do exactly what their name implies — they extend functionality. And AdGuard uses several extensions of its own, also called userscripts, to broaden its functions range: 1. AdGuard Assistant (legacy version) This extension assists the user in changing basic AdGuard settings within the browser, without the need to open the app itself. Like Browser Assistant, legacy Assistant works with all macOS compatible browsers. Thanks to this little tool you can do several things without having to leave the browser: add a certain webpage to the &quot;do not block&quot; list, choose and block an especially annoying element on the page, report the website if it still manages to get ads through to you. note This version of Assistant is legacy and there is no point in using it on new systems, since it has been replaced with the full-fledged Browser Assistant. But legacy Assistant might be of help if there is no Browser Assistant extension for your browser. 2. AdGuard Extra This extension is used to solve the more complicated ad blocking cases you might encounter. We would recommend you to always keep it switched on, unless you have a serious reason not to. 3. AdGuard Popup Blocker Prevents all these annoying popup windows from opening when you view webpages. Blocks popup ads on web pages. One of the important features of AdGuard for Mac is that the application can work as a cross-browser userscript manager. You can easily add any scripts you like and manage existing ones without having to switch browsers every time. "},{"title":"Network​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-for-mac/overview/#network","content":" This last panel is dedicated to Network filtering, and you will find extra functionalities here. We do recommend to enable the first two ones: &quot;Automatically filter applications&quot; and &quot;Filter HTTPS protocol&quot;. Those are an important added precaution to better filter your web space. HTTP is the primary protocol for transmitting information over the Internet. Most data including ads is transferred via it, but it has one disadvantage — the connection is unencrypted. Thanks to the HTTPS filtering feature AdGuard has, not only HTTP traffic is filtered, but also HTTPS traffic (S stands for ‘secure’). There are also the options of &quot;Do not filter websites with EV certificates&quot; and &quot;Use AdGuard as an HTTP Proxy&quot;. Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates offer a stronger safety guarantee; owners of such websites have to pass a thorough and globally standardized identity verification process defined by EV guidelines. Which is the reason why some users trust websites with such certificates and prefer not to filter them. As for the second option — well, yes, in fact you can use AdGuard as a regular HTTP proxy server. All traffic coming through it will be filtered. This proxy will also be available on your local network, so you may use it for traffic filtering on other devices that are able to reach the proxy directly. To filter traffic on another device connected to proxy you will need to install an AdGuard root certificate there. After you configure proxy, open your browser and go to this page.

Compatibility with iCloud Private Relay​ Currently, AdGuard and iCloud Private Relay cannot work at the same time. AdGuard has no ability to block ads because iCloud Private Relay encrypts traffic before AdGuard can filter network connections. When iCloud Private Relay is active, any filtering (including local filtering) becomes impossible. Thus, AdGuard can't filter traffic or perform DNS filtering in Safari. That's why by default, AdGuard uses the &quot;default route&quot; which disables iCloud Private Relay. For a deeper understanding of this problem, read this article. Recommended solution We recommend using AdGuard together with a more traditional VPN service such as AdGuard VPN. Alternative solution You can prevent AdGuard from using the &quot;default route&quot; by disabling it. It can be done via Advanced Settings → network.extension.monterey.force.split.tunnel. Note that enabling this setting will cause the problems described above.  Compatibility with Protect Mail Activity​ Apple's Mail app now uses a proxy to hide a user's IP address when downloading images from emails. However, it won't work if there's an active VPN connection. As it treats AdGuard as a VPN, it won't preload images automatically. For a deeper understanding of this problem, read this article.

Compatibility with Cisco AnyConnect​ AdGuard will not work together with Cisco AnyConnect while in the Network Extension mode. You have to switch AdGuard to Automatic Proxy mode. To do so, follow this instruction. Compatibility with Flutter​ This problem is solved in Flutter 2.2, released in June 2021. But to fix it for applications developed in Flutter, you need to wait for updates. If you use Flutter alongside AdGuard in &quot;Network Extension&quot; mode (or any other &quot;Transparent Proxy&quot;-type app) in Monterey or Big Sur, you will run into problems: projects won't open and Flutter will be effectively broken.

If you encounter any issues in OS versions 11.1+, or if you're using Big Sur 11.0, remove the local proxy from System settings and configure an upstream proxy in AdGuard by following the instruction below. To configure an upstream proxy in AdGuard for Mac in Big Sur: Open AdGuard's settings Preferences → Network → Outbound proxy.Choose HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4 or SOCKS5, depending on your proxy type.Fill in the fields: host is the IP address of your proxy server,port is the desired port number to be used by the proxy server,user and password are corresponding username and password of your proxy (if needed). Ignore either or both when not applicable. If you run into any problems, please contact our tech support at support@adguard.com. Example 1: Configuring an upstream Shadowsocks proxy​ Here's an example of how to configure an upstream proxy for Shadowsocks. First of all, you need a working server side for your proxy. Most likely, to set it up, you would use a JSON file like this (server and password values were chosen randomly here): { &quot;server&quot;:&quot;111.222.333.444&quot;, &quot;server_port&quot;:8388, &quot;local_port&quot;:1080, &quot;password&quot;:&quot;barfoo!&quot;, &quot;timeout&quot;:600, &quot;method&quot;:&quot;chacha20-ietf-poly1305&quot; }  tip You can find more information about how to get started on Shadowsocks website. Then you'd have to install Shadowsocks client on your Mac. Make sure that you select 'Manual Mode' or 'Auto Mode' in its settings! The configuration won't work if you select 'Global Mode' (or 'Auto Mode' in Big Sur versions prior to 11.1).  Now go to AdGuard menu → Advanced → Advanced Settings... and set the Value area of the upstream.proxy setting to socks5://localhost:1080. Notice that you need to use &quot;local_port&quot; value from the JSON file here. Because Shadowsocks uses SOCKS5, you also need to set the value of the upstream.proxy.socks5udp setting in AdGuard Advanced Settings to true to make AdGuard route UDP traffic to the proxy server. Example 2: Configuring an upstream Surge proxy​ In Big Sur v11.1+, there are no known conflicts between AdGuard and Surge proxy. If you are using an older version of Big Sur (prior to 11.1), check that System Proxy in the bottom right corner is disabled. Otherwise, Surge won't work with AdGuard. On the other hand, Enhanced Mode can be enabled without causing a conflict in any Big Sur version.  Now go to Preferences → Network → Outbound proxy and fill in the fields.

The extension and the app worked in conjunction but sometimes the integration would fail. Some websites would stop being protected by the desktop program and be backed up only by the less powerful extension.

First, to avoid being tracked by your ISP. Every time you open a website, for example google.com, your browser sends a request to a DNS server to get the IP address of the website in return. Usually, the DNS server belongs to your ISP, which allows them to track your online activity. Second, to encrypt you DNS traffic. And the third one is to block content on DNS level.  In the DNS protection module of AdGuard for Windows you can select the DNS servers from known DNS providers, including AdGuard DNS that blocks ads and trackers, AdGuard DNS Family Protection that in addition blocks adult content, or AdGuard DNS Non-filtering that provides a secure and reliable connection, but doesn't filter anything.

This module not only blocks directions to undesirable sites but can also delete the links that are inappropriate for children from the search results. In the Parental Control module you can enable the Safe search and manage the blocklist and the allowlist to customize how this option works. You can also check the Block executable files download box to prevent your child from downloading and installing software on the computer.

Otherwise, extensions can be downloaded and installed manually. The following extensions are installed with AdGuard:  AdGuard Assistant AdGuard Assistant is Legacy Assistant that you may use if the new Assistant is not available for your browser. The name of this extension is quite deliberate: it actually assists the user in changing basic AdGuard settings right in the browser, without the need to open the app itself. AdGuard Assistant works with all Microsoft Windows compatible browsers. In addition, the AdGuard Assistant icon will not be displayed on websites listed as exceptions by the user and on certain web pages where there is a risk of incorrect content display. AdGuard Extra This is a custom extension designed to fight the technique of re-inserting blocked ads — the so-called ad blocker circumvention/ad reinjection. Both are advanced anti-ad blocker methods that continue to rise in popularity among advertisers. AdGuard Extra is essentially a mini-program that changes the way pages work,and it does so in such a way that it becomes much more difficult for sites to use the above-mentioned functions to bypass blockers. AdGuard Popup Blocker This extension prevents popup windows from opening when you view web pages. Some pop-ups are considered useful — they may contain settings for site administering or additional reference information demonstrated upon clicking a link. That is why you can turn off the Blocker if needed. This extension doesn’t work on websites added to the AdGuard exceptions list either. It is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings. You will find more detailed information about this extension in our Knowledge base. Web of Trust Web of Trust lets you see the reputation of each website based on its users’ opinions.

From many sites, like youtube.com, facebook.com and twitter.com, it is impossible to remove ads without HTTPS filtering. So keep the Filter HTTPS protocol feature enabled unless you have a strong reason not to.  In this module you can check the checkbox &quot;Use AdGuard as an HTTP proxy&quot; to use AdGuard as a regular HTTP proxy which will filter all traffic passing through it. You can also enable the Filter websites with EV certificates feature. Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates offer a stronger safety guarantee; owners of such websites have to pass a thorough and globally standardized identity verification process defined by EV guidelines. Which is the reason why some users trust websites with such certificates and prefer not to filter them. At last, there is a section with proxy settings. There you can specify which proxy server AdGuard should use to update filters, get new versions and so on.

However, changing some of their default settings may cause the apps to work incorrectly when they run at the same time. There are two specific settings in AdGuard for Windows: Use redirect driver mode and Filter localhost. By default, the first is disabled, and the second is enabled. Changing any of these settings will inevitably disrupt AdGuard's filtering if both AdGuard Ad Blocker and AdGuard VPN are enabled on your device. Changing these settings is only necessary to resolve issues related to the simultaneous operation of AdGuard Ad Blocker and network-level apps such as antiviruses, VPNs, and network filters. If you come across a situation where you need to change the default state of the above settings and still want AdGuard Ad Blocker and AdGuard VPN to work simultaneously and correctly — create an issue on GitHub so we can help you personally. We are currently working on overcoming the above-listed limitations of the simultaneous work of our apps.

They interpret filtering rules and perform actions on web traffic based on what the rules tell them to do: block specific elements, alter web pages in certain ways, etc.  "},{"title":"Filter lists​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#filter-lists","content":"To better understand ad blocking, it's important to know the underlying principles of how filters work. Filtering rules that make up filters are not created automatically. They are developed by filter maintainers, including professionals and volunteers, who use browser developer consoles and other tools (such as the AdGuard's filtering log) to determine which rules will block a particular ad or tracker. This description of the process is very simplistic — some ads are particularly hard to block and require multiple rules, multiple iterations, and the use of complex syntax. And even when a rule finally gets added to a filter, it doesn't mean that it stays there forever. Ads change, ways to serve the same ads on the same websites change, and the filter rules have to change, too. Sometimes rules become obsolete, a new ad appears, or a new filtering rule is needed to block the same ad. Filters are often maintained by one person, but even for a team of maintainers, it's impossible to constantly monitor the entire web. That's why many ad blockers have tools to help users easily report any filter-related issues they encounter.  AdGuard users have access to a special web reporting tool. Thanks to user complaints, filter developers can focus on correcting their filter lists and not on scouring the Internet for new and old unblocked ads. Filters can do more than just block ads. There are filters that block tracking, social media widgets, and annoyances such as cookie notices. Different users may choose different combinations of filters to match their personal preferences. There are websites like filterlists.com that are dedicated to filter lists and have huge databases. We develop and maintain our own set of filter lists that can be used with AdGuard or other ad blockers. "},{"title":"Types of filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#types-of-filtering-rules","content":"There are many types of filtering rules that serve different purposes. Depending on the ad blocker you use, and especially on your OS, some types of rules may not be supported. "},{"title":"Basic filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#basic-filtering-rules","content":"To be displayed on a web page or in an app, the ad has to be loaded from a server first. To do so, the browser or the app needs to send a web request. The most basic way of preventing an ad from appearing on your screen is to block this request so it never reaches the server, and thus there's no reply. Basically, all AdGuard Ad Blocker products can block web requests according to the active filter rules. This method is very effective at stopping the ad, but it has some drawbacks. The most obvious one is: whatever place an ad was taking up will be left empty or occupied by an ad leftover. "},{"title":"Cosmetic filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#cosmetic-filtering-rules","content":"Every web page has a Document Object Model (DOM), an HTML document containing the structure and elements of this page. As ads are also page elements, they get recorded in the DOM. Ad blockers can remove parts of the DOM, while filtering rules help them understand which parts are ads and should be removed, and which parts should be left intact. This method allows you to avoid above-mentioned blank spaces and ad leftovers, as well as perform other more complicated tasks. "},{"title":"HTML filtering rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How ad blocking works","url":"general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/#html-filtering-rules","content":"In most cases, it's enough to use the above-mentioned basic and cosmetic rules to filter ads. But when it is necessary to change the HTML code of the page itself before it is loaded, you need filtering rules for HTML content. These rules allow you to specify the HTML elements to be cut out before the browser even loads the page. These rules are quite complicated and require the ad blocker to be granted certain access rights, so not all platforms support them. Currently, these rules work only in the AdGuard Firefox add-on and in the AdGuard apps for Windows, Mac, and Android. info There are other types of filtering rules, but they require more advanced technical knowledge to understand how they work.

This helps you find exactly what you are searching for. Moreover, search ads (because they go through manual moderation) are often more relevant and helpful than the rest of the search results. Another argument in defense of search ads is that they are much less intrusive than many other ad formats.

Our general stance here is very similar to the EasyList policy regarding self-promotion ads. According to our filter policy, we should not block these ads; however, we should not make an exception if such an ad gets blocked by some rule 'alongside' a regular ad. Partly, this is due to ethical reasons, but mostly because such ads are rarely too intrusive and are often useful for the visitor of the website (who is supposedly interested in this website's content).

Over the years, more and more ad filters have been appearing. And the more ad filters are there, the more memory AdGuard consumes, thus slowing down the rendering of web pages.

However, current cryptographic mechanisms aren’t so good at detecting malicious websites if they’re provisioned with mistakenly issued certificates or certificates that have been issued by a certificate authority (CA) that’s been compromised or gone rogue. Certificate Transparency aims to remedy these certificate-based threats by making the issuance and existence of SSL certificates open to scrutiny by domain owners, CAs, and domain users. AdGuard products which use CoreLibs starting with version 1.11 will implement a policy based on Chrome Certificate Transparency Policy.

Please read the technical explanation below. AdGuard is a network-level content blocker so it cannot simply add custom JavaScript and CSS to webpages like what browser extensions do. However, doing this is crucial for quality content blocking.In order to do it AdGuard injects a &quot;content script&quot; that looks like this: &lt;script src=&quot;https://local.adguard.org/.../content-script.js&quot;&gt;. This &quot;content script&quot; takes care of cosmetic filtering, hides or removes ad content from the web pages.Connections to the IP address of the local.adguard.org domain are intercepted by AdGuard on the network level and processed locally. This is why that domain has a &quot;static&quot; IP address that does not change for years. Why do we need to use a real IP address for that? We cannot use 127.0.0.1 as the browsers won't accept it.Using some IP address from the private subnets is possible, but this solution has two downsides. First, there is a slight chance of intersecting with an existing intranet service and breaking access to it.Second, some DNS servers may consider this a DNS rebinding attack and refuse to respond to local.adguard.org.

HTTPS 트래픽이 필터링되지 않으면 어떻게 해야 할까요? 우선, 많은 앱(최신 앱 포함)이 여전히 사용자 인증서를 신뢰합니다. 거의 모든 브라우저는 이러한 인증서도 신뢰합니다. 이 인증서를 신뢰하지 않는 일부 브라우저가 있을 수 있지만 드문 경우입니다. 그리고 기기가 루팅된 경우, AdGuard 인증서를 시스템 저장소로 이동할 수 있습니다. 이렇게하면 특정 앱에 권한이 있는지 여부에 대해 걱정할 필요가 없습니다.

It contains the URL of the request source. When you navigate from one page to another, Referer saves the URL of the initial page. The server that hosts the destination web page often has software that parses Referer and extracts various pieces of information from it. Enabling the Hide Referer from third-parties option hides the current website from third-party sites by altering the HTTP header. You can also set an arbitrary value for Referer by entering it into the Custom Referer field. To use default Referer, leave the field blank. Note that to be able to filter traffic, AdGuard applications 'intercept' browser-to-server requests. Requests to ad, tracking, and phishing servers may be altered before sending them to the server or blocked completely. Same goes for the Hide Referer from third parties option: AdGuard intercepts HTTP(S) requests, in particular to remove or change the Referer header if this option is enabled. However, it happens only after these requests “leave” the browser. This means that if you monitor Referer inside the browser (for example, with the help of Chrome's Developer Tools), you will see the original Referer because the request hasn't reached AdGuard yet. You can use software like Fiddler to make sure that Referer gets altered correctly. On the opposite, due to the nature of all browser extensions, AdGuard Browser Extension works 'inside' the browser.

This might be not too important on Windows and Mac, but this is very important on mobile devices where some of the filtering rules must be app-specific. Android — use the app package name, e.g. org.example.app.Windows — use the process name, e.g. chrome.exe.Mac — use the bundle ID or the process name, e.g. com.google.Chrome. For Mac, you can find out the bundle ID or the process name of the app by viewing the respective request details in the Filtering log. Examples ||baddomain.com^$app=org.example.app — a rule to block requests that match the specified mask and are sent from the org.example.app Android app.||baddomain.com^$app=org.example.app1|org.example.app2 — the same rule but it works for both org.example.app1 and org.example.app2 apps. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain apps, start the app name with the ~ sign. ||baddomain.com^$app=~org.example.app — a rule to block requests that match the specified mask and are sent from any app save for the org.example.app.||baddomain.com^$app=~org.example.app1|~org.example.app2 — same as above, but now two apps are excluded: org.example.app1 and org.example.app2. Restrictions Apps in the modifier value cannot have a wildcard, e.g. $app=com.*.music. Rules with such modifier are considered invalid. Compatibility Only AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android are technically capable of using rules with $app modifier.On Windows the process name is case-insensitive starting with AdGuard for Windows versions that have CoreLibs v1.12 under the hood. $denyallow​ $denyallow modifier allows to avoid creating additional rules when it is needed to disable a certain rule for specific domains. $denyallow matches only target domains and not referrer domains. Adding this modifier to a rule is equivalent to excluding the domains by the rule's matching pattern or to adding the corresponding exclusion rules. To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Examples This rule: *$script,domain=a.com|b.com,denyallow=x.com|y.com  is equivalent to this one: /^(?!.*(x.com|y.com)).*$/$script,domain=a.com|b.com  or to the combination of these three: *$script,domain=a.com|b.com @@||x.com$script,domain=a.com|b.com @@||y.com$script,domain=a.com|b.com  Restrictions The rule's matching pattern cannot target any specific domains, e.g. it cannot start with ||.Domains in the modifier value cannot be negated, e.g. $denyallow=~x.com, or have a wildcard TLD, e.g. $denyallow=x.*. The rules which violate these restrictions are considered invalid. Compatibility Rules with $denyallow modifier are not supported by AdGuard for iOS, Safari, and AdGuard Content Blocker. $domain​ $domain limits the rule scope to requests made from the specified domains and their subdomains (as indicated by the Referer HTTP header). Syntax The modifier is a list of one or more expressions separated by the | symbol, each of which is matched against a domain in a particular way depending on its type (see below). domains = [&quot;~&quot;] entry_0 [&quot;|&quot; [&quot;~&quot;] entry_1 [&quot;|&quot; [&quot;~&quot;]entry_2 [&quot;|&quot; ... [&quot;|&quot; [&quot;~&quot;]entry_N]]]] entry_i = ( regular_domain / any_tld_domain / regexp )  regular_domain — a regular domain name (domain.com). Corresponds the specified domain and its subdomains. It is matched lexicographically.any_tld_domain — a domain name ending with a wildcard character as a public suffix, e.g. for example.* it is co.uk in example.co.uk. Corresponds to the specified domain and its subdomains with any public suffix. It is matched lexicographically.regexp — a regular expression, starts and ends with /. The pattern works the same way as in the basic URL rules, but the characters /, $, and | must be escaped with \\. info Rules with $domain modifier as regular_domain or any_tld_domain are supported by all AdGuard products. Examples Just $domain: ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org blocks requests that match the specified mask, and are sent from domain example.org or its subdomains.||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|example.com — the same rule, but it works for both example.org and example.com. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain domains, start a domain name with ~ sign. $domain and negation ~: ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org blocks requests that match the specified mask and are sent from the example.org domain or its subdomains.||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|example.com — the same rule, but it works for both example.org and example.com.||baddomain.com^$domain=~example.org blocks requests matching the pattern sent from any domain except example.org and its subdomains.||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|~foo.example.org blocks requests sent from example.org and its subdomains, except the subdomain foo.example.org.||baddomain.com^$domain=/(^\\|.+\\.)example\\.(com\\|org)\\$/ blocks requests sent from example.org and example.com domains and all their subdomains.||baddomain.com^$domain=~a.com|~b.*|~/(^\\|.+\\.)c\\.(com\\|org)\\$/ blocks requests sent from any domains, except a.com, b with any public suffix (b.com, b.co.uk, etc.), c.com, c.org, and their subdomains. $domain modifier matching target domain: In some cases the $domain modifier can match not only the referrer domain, but also the target domain. This happens when all of the following is true: The request has document content type.The rule pattern does not match any particular domains.The rule pattern does not contain regular expressions.The $domain modifier contains only excluded domains, e.g. $domain=~example.org|~example.com. The following predicate should be satisfied to perform a target domain matching: 1 AND ((2 AND 3) OR 4)  That is, if the modifier $domain contains only excluded domains, then the rule does not need to meet the second and third conditions to match the target domain against the modifier $domain. If some of the conditions above are not met but the rule contains $cookie or $csp modifier, the target domain will still be matched. If the referrer matches a rule with $domain that explicitly excludes the referrer domain, then the rule will not be applied even if the target domain also matches the rule. This affects rules with $cookie and $csp modifiers, too. Examples *$cookie,domain=example.org|example.com will block cookies for all requests to and from example.org and example.com.*$document,domain=example.org|example.com will block all requests to and from example.org and example.com. In the following examples it is implied that requests are sent from http://example.org/page (the referrer) and the target URL is http://targetdomain.com/page. page$domain=example.org will be matched, as it matches the referrer domain.page$domain=targetdomain.com will be matched, as it matches the target domain and satisfies all requirements mentioned above.||*page$domain=targetdomain.com will not be matched, as the pattern ||*page may match specific domains, e.g. example.page.||*page$domain=targetdomain.com,cookie will be matched because the rule contains $cookie modifier despite the pattern ||*page may match specific domains./banner\\d+/$domain=targetdomain.com will not be matched as it contains a regular expression.page$domain=targetdomain.com|~example.org will not be matched because the referrer domain is explicitly excluded. $domain modifier limitations​ Restrictions Safari does not support the simultaneous use of allowed and disallowed domains, so rules like ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|~foo.example.org will not work in AdGuard for iOS and AdGuard for Safari. Compatibility Rules with regular expressions in the $domain modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs v1.11 or later. In AdGuard for Windows, Mac and Android running CoreLibs v1.12 or later the $domain modifier can be alternatively spelled as $from. $header​ The $header modifier allows matching the HTTP response having a specific header with (optionally) a specific value. Syntax $header &quot;=&quot; h_name [&quot;:&quot; h_value] h_value = string / regexp  where: h_name — required, an HTTP header name. It is matched case-insesitively.h_value — optional, an HTTP header value matching expression, it may be one of the following: string — a sequence of characters. It is matched against the header value lexicographically;regexp — a regular expression, starts and ends with /. The pattern works the same way as in the basic URL rules, but the characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \\. The modifier &quot;:&quot; h_value part may be omitted. In that case, the modifier matches the header name only. Examples ||example.com^$header=set-cookie:foo blocks requests whose responses have the Set-Cookie header with the value matching foo literally.||example.com^$header=set-cookie blocks requests whose responses have the Set-Cookie header with any value.@@||example.com^$header=set-cookie:/foo\\, bar\\$/ unblocks requests whose responses have the Set-Cookie header with value matching the foo, bar$ regular expression.@@||example.com^$header=set-cookie unblocks requests whose responses have a Set-Cookie header with any value. Compatibility Rules with the $header modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.11 or later. $important​ The $important modifier applied to a rule increases its priority over any other rule without $important modifier. Even over basic exception rules. Go to rules priorities for more details. Examples ! blocking rule will block all requests despite of the exception rule ||example.org^$important @@||example.org^  ! if the exception rule also has `$important` modifier, it will prevail and requests won't be blocked ||example.org^$important @@||example.org^$important  $match-case​ This modifier defines a rule which applies only to addresses that match the case. Default rules are case-insensitive. Examples */BannerAd.gif$match-case — this rule will block http://example.com/BannerAd.gif, but not http://example.com/bannerad.gif. Compatibility Rules with the $match-case are supported by AdGuard for iOS and Safari, running SafariConverterLib v2.0.41 or later. All other products already support this modifier. $method​ This modifier limits the rule scope to requests that use the specified set of HTTP methods. Negated methods are allowed. The methods must be specified in all lowercase characters, but are matched case-insensitively. To add multiple methods to one rule, use the vertical bar | as a separator. Examples ||evil.com^$method=get|head blocks only GET and HEAD requests to evil.com.||evil.com^$method=~post|~put blocks any requests to evil.com except POST or PUT.@@||evil.com$method=get unblocks only GET requests to evil.com.@@||evil.com$method=~post unblocks any requests to evil.com except POST. Restrictions Rules with mixed negated and not negated values are considered invalid. So, for example, the rule ||evil.com^$method=get|~head will be rejected. Compatibility Rules with the $method are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, running CoreLibs v1.12 or later, and AdGuard Browser Extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, running TSUrlFilter v2.1.1 or later. $popup​ AdGuard will try to close the browser tab with any address that matches a blocking rule with this modifier. Please note that not all the tabs can be closed. Examples ||domain.com^$popup — if you try to go to http://domain.com/ from any page in the browser, a new tab in which specified site has to be opened will be closed by this rule. Compatibility $popup modifier works best in AdGuard Browser Extension.In AdGuard for Safari and iOS, $popup rules simply block the page right away.In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, $popup modifier may not detect a popup in some cases and it will not be blocked. $popup modifier applies the document content type with a special flag which is passed to a blocking page. Blocking page itself can do some checks and close the window if it is really a popup. Otherwise, page should be loaded. It can be combined with other request type modifiers, such as $third-party and $important.Rules with $popup modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $third-party​ A restriction of third-party and own requests. A third-party request is a request from a different domain. For example, a request to example.org from domain.com is a third-party request. note To be considered as such, a third-party request should meet one of the following conditions: Its referrer is not a subdomain of the target domain or vice versa. For example, a request to subdomain.example.org from example.org is not a third-party request.Its Sec-Fetch-Site header is set to cross-site. If there is a $third-party modifier, the rule is only applied to third-party requests. Examples $third-party: ||domain.com^$third-party — this rule applies to all domains, except domain.com and its subdomains. An example of a third-party request: http://example.org/banner.jpg. If there is a $~third-party modifier, the rule is only applied to the requests that are not from third parties. Which means, they have to be sent from the same domain. $~third-party: ||domain.com$~third-party — this rule is applied to domain.com, but not to the other domains. Example of a request that is not a third-party request: http://domain.com/icon.ico. note You may use a shorter name (alias) instead of using the full modifier name: $3p. $to​ $to limits the rule scope to requests made to the specified domains and their subdomains. To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Examples /ads$to=evil.com|evil.org blocks any request to evil.com or evil.org and their subdomains with a path matching /ads./ads$to=~not.evil.com|evil.com blocks any request to evil.com and its subdomains, with a path matching /ads, except requests to not.evil.com and its subdomains./ads$to=~good.com|~good.org blocks any request with a path matching /ads, except requests to good.com or good.org and their subdomains. Restrictions $denyallow can not be used together with $to. It can be expressed with inverted $to: $denyallow=a.com|b.com is equivalent to $to=~a.com|~b.com. Compatibility Rules with the $to modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs v1.12 or later, and AdGuard Browser Extension, running TSUrlFilter v2.1.3 or later. "},{"title":"Content-type modifiers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#content-type-modifiers","content":"There is a set of modifiers, which can be used to limit the rule's application area to certain type of content. These modifiers can also be combined to cover, for example, both images and scripts. Compatibility There is a big difference in how AdGuard determines the content type on different platforms. For AdGuard Browser Extension, content type for every request is provided by the browser. AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android use the following method: first, the apps try to determine the type of the request by the Sec-Fetch-Dest request header or by the filename extension. If the request is not blocked at this stage, the type will be determined using the Content-Type header at the beginning of the server response. Examples of content-type modifiers ||example.org^$image — corresponds to all images from example.org.||example.org^$script,stylesheet — corresponds to all the scripts and styles from example.org.||example.org^$~image,~script,~stylesheet — corresponds to all requests to example.org except for the images, scripts and styles.

It does not match iframes, there is a $subdocument modifier for these. By default, AdGuard does not block the requests that are loaded in the browser tab (e.g. &quot;main frame bypass&quot;). The idea is not to prevent pages from loading as the user clearly indicated that they want this page to be loaded. However, if the $document modifier is specified explicitly, AdGuard does not use that logic and prevents the page load. Instead, it responds with a &quot;blocking page&quot;. If this modifier is used with an exclusion rule (@@), it completely disables blocking on corresponding pages. It is equivalent to using $elemhide, $content, $urlblock, $jsinject, $extension modifiers simultaneously. Examples @@||example.com^$document completely disables filtering on all pages at example.com and all subdomains. ||example.com^$document blocks HTML document request to example.com with a blocking page. ||example.com^$document,redirect=noopframe redirects HTML document request to example.com to an empty html document. ||example.com^$document,removeparam=test removes test query parameter from HTML document request to example.com. ||example.com^$document,replace=/test1/test2/ replaces test1 with test2 in HTML document request to example.com. note You may use a shorter name (alias) instead of using the full modifier name: $doc. $font​ The rule corresponds to requests for fonts, e.g. .woff filename extension. $image​ The rule corresponds to images requests. $media​ The rule corresponds to requests for media files — music and video, e.g. .mp4 files. $object​ The rule corresponds to browser plugins resources, e.g. Java or Flash. $other​ The rule applies to requests for which the type has not been determined or does not match the types listed above. $ping​ The rule corresponds to requests caused by either navigator.sendBeacon() or the ping attribute on links. Compatibility AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android often cannot accurately detect navigator.sendBeacon(). Using $ping is not recommended in the filter lists that are supposed to be used by CoreLibs-based AdGuard products. Rules with $ping modifier are not supported by AdGuard for Safari and iOS. $script​ The rule corresponds to script requests, e.g. javascript, vbscript. $stylesheet​ The rule corresponds to CSS files requests. note You may use a shorter name (alias) instead of using the full modifier name: $css. $subdocument​ The rule corresponds to requests for built-in pages — HTML tags frame and iframe. Examples ||example.com^$subdocument blocks built-in page requests (frame and iframe) to example.com and all its subdomains anywhere.||example.com^$subdocument,domain=domain.com blocks built-in page requests (frame и iframe) to example.com (and its subdomains) from domain.com and all its subdomains. note You may use a shorter name (alias) instead of using the full modifier name: $frame. Compatibility In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android subdocuments are being detected by the Sec-Fetch-Dest header if it is present. Otherwise, some main pages may be treated as subdocuments. Rules with $subdocument modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $websocket​ The rule applies only to WebSocket connections. Compatibility $websocket modifier is supported in all AdGuard products except AdGuard Content Blocker. As for AdGuard for Safari and AdGuard for iOS, it's supported on devices with macOS Monterey (version 12) and iOS 16 or higher. $xmlhttprequest​ The rule applies only to ajax requests (requests sent via javascript object XMLHttpRequest). note You may use a shorter name (alias) instead of using the full modifier name: $xhr. Compatibility AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android when filtering older browsers cannot accurately detect this type and sometimes detects it as $other or $script. They can only reliably detect this content type when filtering modern browsers that support Fetch metadata request headers. $object-subrequest (removed)​ Removal notice $object-subrequest modifier is removed and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. The rule corresponds to requests by browser plugins (it is usually Flash). $webrtc (removed)​ Removal notice This modifier is removed and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. If you need to suppress WebRTC, consider using the nowebrtc scriptlet. The rule applies only to WebRTC connections.

Syntax $extension[=&quot;userscript_name1&quot;[|&quot;userscript_name2&quot;[|&quot;userscript_name3&quot;[...]]]]  userscript_name(i) stands for a specific userscript name to be disabled by the modifier. The modifier can contain any number of userscript names or not contain them at all. In the latter case the modifier disables all the userscripts. Userscript names usually contain spaces or other special characters, which is why you should enclose the name in quotes. Both single (') and double (&quot;) ASCII quotes are supported. Multiple userscript names should be separated with a pipe (|). However, if a userscript name is a single word without any special characters, it can be used without quotes. You can also exclude a userscript by adding a ~ character before it. In this case, the userscript will not be disabled by the modifier. $extension=~&quot;userscript name&quot;  note When excluding a userscript, you must place ~ outside the quotes.

Examples /some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is disabled for example.com by /some$domain=example.com,badfilter/some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is disabled for example.com and example.org by /some$domain=example.com|example.org,badfilter/some$domain=example.com|example.org and /some$domain=example.io are disabled completely by /some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io,badfilter/some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is disabled completely by /some$domain=example.*,badfilter/some$domain=example.* is disabled for example.com and example.org by /some$domain=example.com|example.org,badfilter/some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is NOT disabled for example.com by /some$domain=example.com|~example.org,badfilter because the value of $domain modifier contains a negated domain Compatibility Rules with $badfilter modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $cookie​ The $cookie modifier completely changes rule behavior. Instead of blocking a request, this modifier makes AdGuard suppress or modify the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $cookie rules match a single request, we will apply each of them one by one. Syntax $cookie [= name[; maxAge = seconds [; sameSite = strategy ]]]  where: name — optional, string or regular expression to match cookie name.seconds — number of seconds for current time to offset the expiration date of cookie.strategy — string for Same-Site strategy to make cookie use. For example, ||example.org^$cookie=NAME;maxAge=3600;sameSite=lax  every time AdGuard encounters a cookie called NAME in a request to example.org, it will do the following: Set its expiration date to current time plus 3600 secondsMakes the cookie use Same-Site &quot;lax&quot; strategy. Escaping special characters If regular expression name is used for matching, two characters must be escaped: comma , and dollar sign $. Use backslash \\ escape each of them. For example, escaped comma looks like this: \\,. Examples ||example.org^$cookie blocks all cookies set by example.org; this is an equivalent to setting maxAge=0$cookie=__cfduid blocks CloudFlare cookie everywhere$cookie=/__utm[a-z]/ blocks Google Analytics cookies everywhere||facebook.com^$third-party,cookie=c_user prevents Facebook from tracking you even if you are logged in There are two methods to deactivate $cookie rules: the primary method involves using an exception marked with @@ — @@||example.org^$cookie. The alternative method employs a $urlblock exception (also included under the $document exception alias — $elemhide,jsinject,content,urlblock,extension). Here's how it works: @@||example.org^$cookie unblocks all cookies set by example.org@@||example.org^$urlblock unblocks all cookies set by example.org and disables blocking of all requests sent from example.org@@||example.org^$cookie=concept unblocks a single cookie named concept@@||example.org^$cookie=/^_ga_/ unblocks every cookie that matches the regular expression Restrictions $cookie rules support a limited list of modifiers: $domain, $~domain, $important, $third-party, and $~third-party. Compatibility Rules with $cookie modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $csp​ This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied to a rule, the rule will not block the matching request. Response headers will be modified instead. info In order to use this type of rules, it is required to have the basic understanding of the Content Security Policy security layer. For the requests matching a $csp rule, we will strengthen response security policy by enhancing the content security policy, similar to the content security policy of the $csp modifier contents. $csp rules are applied independently from any other rule type. Other basic rules have no influence on it save for document-level exceptions (see the examples section below). Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $csp rules match a single request, we will apply each of them. Syntax $csp value syntax is similar to the Content Security Policy header syntax. $csp value can be empty in the case of exception rules. See examples section below. Examples ||example.org^$csp=frame-src 'none' blocks all frames on example.org and its subdomains.@@||example.org/page/*$csp=frame-src 'none' disables all rules with the $csp modifier exactly matching frame-src 'none' on all the pages matching the rule pattern.

Restrictions There are a few characters forbidden in the $csp value: ,, $.$csp rules support limited list of modifiers: $domain, $important, $subdocument.Rules with report-* directives are considered invalid. Compatibility Rules with $csp modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $hls​ $hls rules modify the response of a matching request. They are intended as a convenient way to remove segments from HLS playlists (RFC 8216). note The word &quot;segment&quot; in this document means either a &quot;Media Segment&quot; or a &quot;playlist&quot; as part of a &quot;Master Playlist&quot;: $hls rules do not distinguish between a &quot;Master Playlist&quot; and a &quot;Media Playlist&quot;. Syntax ||example.org^$hls=urlpattern removes segments whose URL matches the URL pattern urlpattern. The pattern works just like the one in basic URL rules, however, the characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \\ inside urlpattern.||example.org^$hls=/regexp/options removes segments where the URL or one of the tags (for certain options, if present) is matched by the regular expression regexp. Available options are: t — instead of testing the segment's URL, test each of the segment's tags against the regular expression. A segment with a matching tag is removed;i — make the regular expression case-insensitive. The characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \\ inside regexp. Exceptions Basic URL exceptions shall not disable rules with $hls modifier. They can be disabled as described below: @@||example.org^$hls disables all $hls rules for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$hls=text disables all $hls rules with the value of the $hls modifier equal to text for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^. tip $hls rules can also be disabled by $document, $content and $urlblock exception rules. note When multiple $hls rules match the same request, their effect is cumulative. Examples ||example.org^$hls=\\/videoplayback^?*&amp;source=dclk_video_ads removes all segments with the matching URL.||example.org^$hls=/\\/videoplayback\\/?\\?.*\\&amp;source=dclk_video_ads/i achieves more or less the same with a regular expression instead of a URL pattern.||example.org^$hls=/#UPLYNK-SEGMENT:.*\\,ad/t removes all segments which have the matching tag. Anatomy of an HLS playlist A quick summary of the specification: An HLS playlist is a collection of text lines.A line may be empty, a comment (starts with #), a tag (also starts with #, can only be recognized by name) or a URL.A URL line is called a &quot;segment&quot;.Tags may apply to a single segment, i.e. the first URL line after the tag, to all segments following the tag and until the tag with the same name, or to the whole playlist. Some points specific to the operation of $hls rules: When a segment is removed, all of the tags that apply only to that segment are also removed.When there is a tag that applies to multiple segments, and all of those segments are removed, the tag is also removed.Since there is no way to recognize different kinds of tags by syntax, we recognize all of the tags specified by the RFC, plus some non-standard tags that we have seen in the field. Any lines starting with # and not recognized as a tag are passed through without modification, and are not matched against the rules.We do not match tags that apply to the whole playlist, and $hls rules can not be used to remove them, since $hls rules are intended for removing segments. If you know what you are doing, you can use $replace rules to remove or rewrite just a single tag from the playlist. An example of a transformation done by the rules: Original response #EXTM3U #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10 #EXTINF,5 preroll.ts #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,ad #UPLYNK-KEY:aabb1122 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,segment #UPLYNK-KEY:ccdd2233 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #EXT-X-ENDLIST  Applied rules ||example.org^$hls=preroll ||example.org^$hls=/#UPLYNK-SEGMENT:.*\\,ad/t  Modified response #EXTM3U #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10 #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,segment #UPLYNK-KEY:ccdd2233 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #EXT-X-ENDLIST  Restrictions $hls rules are only allowed in trusted filters.$hls rules are compatible with the modifiers $domain, $third-party, $app, $important, $match-case, and $xmlhttprequest only.$hls rules only apply to HLS playlists, which are UTF-8 encoded text starting with the line #EXTM3U. Any other response will not be modified by these rules.$hls rules do not apply if the size of the original response is more than 3 MB. Compatibility Rules with the $hls modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. $inline-script​ $inline-script modifier is a sort of a shortcut for $csp modifier with specific value. E.g. the rule ||example.org^$inline-script is converting into such a rule: ||example.org^$csp=script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: data: blob: mediastream: filesystem:  $inline-font​ $inline-font modifier is a sort of a shortcut for $csp modifier with specific value. E.g. the rule ||example.org^$inline-font is converting into such a rule: ||example.org^$csp=font-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: data: blob: mediastream: filesystem:  $jsonprune​ $jsonprune rules modify the response to a matching request by removing JSON items that match a modified JSONPath expression. They do not modify responses which are not valid JSON documents. In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android running CoreLibs v1.11 or later, $jsonprune also supports modifying JSONP (padded JSON) documents. Syntax ||example.org^$jsonprune=expression removes items that match the modified JSONPath expression expression from the response. Due to the way rule parsing works, the characters $ and , must be escaped with \\ inside expression. The modified JSONPath syntax has the following differences from the original: Script expressions are not supported.The supported filter expressions are: ?(has &lt;key&gt;) — true if the current object has the specified key.?(key-eq &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;) — true if the current object has the specified key, and its value is equal to the specified value.?(key-substr &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;) — true if the specified value is a substring of the value of the specified key of the current object. Whitespace outside of double- or single-quoted strings has no meaning.Both double- and single-quoted strings can be used.Expressions ending with .. are not supported.Multiple array slices can be specified in square brackets. There are various online tools that make working with JSONPath expressions more convenient: https://www.site24x7.com/tools/jsonpath-finder-validator.html https://jsonpathfinder.com/ https://jsonpath.com/ Keep in mind, though, that all JSONPath implementations have unique features/quirks and are subtly incompatible with each other. Exceptions Basic URL exceptions shall not disable rules with $jsonprune modifier. They can be disabled as described below: @@||example.org^$jsonprune disables all $jsonprune rules for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$jsonprune=text disable all $jsonprune rules with the value of the $jsonprune modifier equal to text for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^. $jsonprune rules can also be disabled by $document, $content and $urlblock exception rules. note When multiple $jsonprune rules match the same request, they are sorted in lexicographical order, the first rule is applied to the original response, and each of the remaining rules is applied to the result of applying the previous one. Examples ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$..[one\\, &quot;two three&quot;] removes all occurrences of the keys &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two three&quot; anywhere in the JSON document. Input { &quot;one&quot;: 1, &quot;two&quot;: { &quot;two three&quot;: 23, &quot;four five&quot;: 45 } }  Output { &quot;two&quot;: { &quot;four five&quot;: 45 } }  ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.a[?(has ad_origin)] removes all children of a that have an ad_origin key. Input { &quot;a&quot;: [ { &quot;ad_origin&quot;: &quot;https://example.org&quot;, &quot;b&quot;: 42 }, { &quot;b&quot;: 1234 } ] }  Output { &quot;a&quot;: [ { &quot;b&quot;: 1234 } ] }  ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.*.*[?(key-eq 'Some key' 'Some value')] removes all items that are at nesting level 3 and have a property &quot;Some key&quot; equal to &quot;Some value&quot;. Input { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Some value&quot;}, &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}}}, &quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: [{&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Some value&quot;}, {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}]} }  Output { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;d&quot;: {&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}}}, &quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: [{&quot;Some key&quot;: &quot;Other value&quot;}]} }  Nested JSONPath expressions In AdGuard for Windows, Mac and Android running CoreLibs v1.11 or later, JSONPath expressions may be used as keys in filter expressions. ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.elems[?(has &quot;\\$.a.b.c&quot;)] removes all children of elems which have a property selectable by the JSONPath expression $.a.b.c. Input { &quot;elems&quot;: [ { &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: 123}}, &quot;k&quot;: &quot;v&quot; }, { &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: 123}}, &quot;k1&quot;: &quot;v1&quot; } ] }  Output { &quot;elems&quot;: [ { &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;e&quot;: {&quot;f&quot;: 123}}, &quot;k1&quot;: &quot;v1&quot; } ] }  ||example.org^$jsonprune=\\$.elems[?(key-eq &quot;\\$.a.b.c&quot; &quot;abc&quot;)] removes all children of elems which have a property selectable by the JSONPath expression $.a.b.c with a value equal to &quot;abc&quot;.

Compatibility Rules with the $jsonprune modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. $network​ This is basically a Firewall-like rule allowing to fully block or unblock access to a specified remote address. $network rules match IP addresses only! You cannot use them to block or unblock access to a domain.To match an IPv6 address, you have to use the collapsed syntax, e.g. use [2001:4860:4860::8888]$network instead of [2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888]$network.An allowlist $network rule makes AdGuard bypass data to the matching endpoint, e.g. there will be no further filtering at all.If the IP part starts and ends with / character, it is treated as a regular expression. We recommend to get acquainted with this article for better understanding of regular expressions. Restrictions The $network modifier can only be used in rules together with the $app and $important modifiers, and not with any other modifiers. Examples 174.129.166.49:3478^$network blocks access to 174.129.166.49:3478 (but not to 174.129.166.49:34788).[2001:4860:4860::8888]:443^$network blocks access to [2001:4860:4860::8888]:443.174.129.166.49$network blocks access to 174.129.166.49:*.@@174.129.166.49$network makes AdGuard bypass data to the endpoint. No other rules will be applied./.+:3[0-9]{4}/$network blocks access to any port from 30000 to 39999./8.8.8.(:?8|4)/$network blocks access to both 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.8.4. Compatibility Only AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android are technically capable of using rules with $network modifier. $permissions​ This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied to a rule, the rule will not block the matching request. Response headers will be modified instead. info In order to use this type of rules, it is required to have a basic understanding of the Permissions Policy security layer. For the requests matching a $permissions rule, AdGuard strengthens response's permissions policy by adding an additional permission policy equal to the $permissions modifier contents. $permissions rules are applied independently from any other rule type. Other basic rules have no influence on it save for document-level exceptions (see the examples section). Multiple rules matching a single request. In case if multiple $permissions rules match a single request, AdGuard will apply each of them. Syntax $permissions value syntax is similar to the Permissions-Policy header syntax with one exception: comma that separates several features MUST be escaped — see examples below. The list of the available directives is available here. $permissions value can be empty in the case of exception rules — see examples below. Examples ||example.org^$permissions=autoplay=() disallows autoplay media requested through the HTMLMediaElement interface across example.org.@@||example.org/page/*$permissions=autoplay=() disables all rules with the $permissions modifier exactly matching autoplay=() on all the pages matching the rule pattern. For instance, the rule above.@@||example.org/page/*$permissions disables all the $permissions rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern.$domain=example.org|example.com,permissions=storage-access=()\\, camera=() disallows using the Storage Access API to request access to unpartitioned cookies and using video input devices across example.org and example.com.@@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$urlblock disables all the $permission rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern. Restrictions Characters forbidden in the $permissions value: $;$permissions is compatible with the limited list of modifiers: $domain, $important, and $subdocument. Compatibility Rules with the $permissions modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.11 or later. $redirect​ AdGuard is able to redirect web requests to a local &quot;resource&quot;. Syntax AdGuard uses the same filtering rules syntax as uBlock Origin. Also, it is compatible with ABP $rewrite=abp-resource modifier. $redirect is a modifier for the basic filtering rules so rules with this modifier support all other basic modifiers like $domain, $third-party, $script, etc. The value of the $redirect modifier must be the name of the resource that will be used for redirection. Disabling $redirect rules​ ||example.org/script.js$script,redirect=noopjs — this rule redirects all requests to example.org/script.js to the resource named noopjs.||example.org/test.mp4$media,redirect=noopmp4-1s — this rule redirects all requests to example.org/test.mp4 to the resource named noopmp4-1s.@@||example.org^$redirect will disable all $redirect rules for URLs that match ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$redirect=nooptext will disable all rules with $redirect=nooptext for any request that matches ||example.org^. More information on redirects and their usage is available on GitHub. Priorities of $redirect rules​ $redirect rules have higher priority than regular basic blocking rules. This means that if there is a basic blocking rule, the $redirect rule will override it. Allowlist rules with @@ mark have higher priority than $redirect rules. If a basic rule with the $important modifier and the $redirect rule matches the same URL, the latter is overridden unless it's also marked as $important. In short: $important &gt; @@ &gt; $redirect &gt; basic rules. Go to rules priorities for more details. Compatibility Rules with $redirect modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari.$redirect in uBlock Origin supports specifying priority, e.g. $redirect=noopjs:42. AdGuard does not support it and instead just discards the priority postfix. $redirect-rule​ This is basically an alias to $redirect since it has the same &quot;redirection&quot; values and the logic is almost similar. The difference is that $redirect-rule is applied only in the case when the target request is blocked by a different basic rule. Go to rules priorities for more details. Negating $redirect-rule works exactly the same way as for regular $redirect rules. Even more than that, @@||example.org^$redirect will negate both $redirect and $redirect-rule rules. Examples ||example.org/script.js ||example.org^$redirect-rule=noopjs  In this case, only requests to example.org/script.js will be &quot;redirected&quot; to noopjs. All other requests to example.org will be kept intact. Compatibility Rules with $redirect-rule modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $referrerpolicy​ These rules allow overriding of a page's referrer policy. Responses to matching requests will have all of their Referrer-Policy headers replaced with a single header with the value equal to the matching rule's modifier value. If the response carries an HTML document with a &lt;meta name=&quot;referrer&quot;... tag, the content attribute of the tag will also be replaced with the modifier value. An exception rule with a modifier value disables the blocking rule with the same modifier value. An exception rule without a modifier value disables all matched referrer-policy rules. If a request matches multiple $referrerpolicy rules not disabled by exceptions, only one of them (it is not specified which one) is applied. Examples ||example.com^$referrerpolicy=unsafe-url overrides the referrer policy for example.com with unsafe-url.@@||example.com^$referrerpolicy=unsafe-url disables the previous rule.@@||example.com/abcd.html^$referrerpolicy disables all $referrerpolicy rules on example.com/abcd.html. Restrictions $referrerpolicy rules are compatible only with $document and $subdocument content-type modifiers. Compatibility Rules with the $referrerpolicy modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.12 or later. $removeheader​ Rules with $removeheader modifier are intended to remove headers from HTTP requests and responses. The initial motivation for this rule type is to be able to get rid of the Refresh header which is often used to redirect users to an undesirable location. However, this is not the only case where this modifier can be useful. Just like $csp, $redirect, $removeparam, and $cookie, this modifier exists independently, rules with it do not depend on the regular basic rules, i.e. regular exception or blocking rules will not affect it. By default, it only affects response headers. However, you can also change it to remove headers from HTTP requests as well. Syntax Basic syntax ||example.org^$removeheader=header-name removes a response header called header-name||example.org^$removeheader=request:header-name removes a request header called header-name $removeheader is case-insensitive, but we suggest always using lower case. Negating $removeheader This type of rules works pretty much the same way it works with $csp and $redirect modifiers. Use @@ to negate $removeheader: @@||example.org^$removeheader negates all $removeheader rules for URLs that match ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$removeheader=header negates the rule with $removeheader=header for any request matching ||example.org^. $removeheader rules can also be disabled by $document and $urlblock exception rules. But basic exception rules without modifiers will not do that. For example, @@||example.com^ will not disable $removeheader=p for requests to example.com, but @@||example.com^$urlblock will. note In case of multiple $removeheader rules matching a single request, we will apply each of them one by one. Examples ||example.org^$removeheader=refresh removes Refresh header from all HTTP responses returned by example.org and its subdomains. ||example.org^$removeheader=request:x-client-data removes X-Client-Data header from all HTTP requests. Next block of rules removes Refresh and Location headers from all HTTP responses returned by example.org save for requests to example.org/path/*, for which no headers will be removed: ||example.org^$removeheader=refresh ||example.org^$removeheader=location @@||example.org/path/$removeheader  Restrictions This type of rules can be used only in trusted filters. In order to avoid compromising the security $removeheader cannot remove headers from the list below: access-control-allow-originaccess-control-allow-credentialsaccess-control-allow-headersaccess-control-allow-methodsaccess-control-expose-headersaccess-control-max-ageaccess-control-request-headersaccess-control-request-methodorigintiming-allow-originallowcross-origin-embedder-policycross-origin-opener-policycross-origin-resource-policycontent-security-policycontent-security-policy-report-onlyexpect-ctfeature-policyorigin-isolationstrict-transport-securityupgrade-insecure-requestsx-content-type-optionsx-download-optionsx-frame-optionsx-permitted-cross-domain-policiesx-powered-byx-xss-protectionpublic-key-pinspublic-key-pins-report-onlysec-websocket-keysec-websocket-extensionssec-websocket-acceptsec-websocket-protocolsec-websocket-versionp3psec-fetch-modesec-fetch-destsec-fetch-sitesec-fetch-userreferrer-policycontent-typecontent-lengthacceptaccept-encodinghostconnectiontransfer-encodingupgrade $removeheader rules are only compatible with $domain, $third-party, $app, $important, $match-case, and content type modifiers such as $script and $stylesheet. The rules which have any other modifiers are considered invalid and will be discarded. Compatibility Rules with $removeheader modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, and AdGuard Browser Extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. $removeparam​ note $queryprune is an alias of $removeparam. Since $queryprune is deprecated, avoid using it and use $removeparam instead. Rules with $removeparam modifier are intended to strip query parameters from requests' URLs. Please note that such rules are only applied to GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and sometimes POST requests. $removeparam rules that do not have any content type modifiers will match only requests where content type is document. Syntax Basic syntax $removeparam=param removes query parameter with the name param from URLs of any request, e.g. a request to http://example.com/page?param=1&amp;another=2 will be transformed into http://example.com/page?another=2. Compatibility $removeparam syntax is supported starting with CoreLibs v1.7 and AdGuard Browser Extension v3.6. Regular expressions You can also use regular expressions to match query parameters and/or their values: $removeparam=/regexp/[options] — removes query parameters that matches the regexp regular expression from URLs of any request. Unlike basic syntax, it means &quot;remove query parameters normalized to a name=value string which match the regexp regular expression&quot;. [options] here is the list of regular expression options. At the moment, the only supported option is i which makes matching case-insensitive. Escaping special characters Do not forget to escape special characters like ,, / and $ in the regular expressions. Use \\ character for that purpose. For example, an escaped comma should look like this: \\,. note Regexp-type rules target both name and value of the parameter. To minimize mistakes, it is safer to start every regexp with /^ unless you specifically target parameter values. We will try to detect and ignore unescaped $ automatically using a simple rule of thumb — it is not an options delimiter if all three are true: It looks like $/;There is another slash character / to the left of it;There is another unescaped dollar sign $ to the left of that slash character. Remove all query parameters Specify naked $removeparam to remove all query parameters: ||example.org^$removeparam — removes all query parameters from URLs matching ||example.org^. Inversion Use ~ to apply inversion: $removeparam=~param — removes all query parameters with the name different from param.$removeparam=~/regexp/ — removes all query parameters that do not match the regexp regular expression. Negating $removeparam This sort of rules work pretty much the same way it works with $csp and $redirect modifiers. Use @@ to negate $removeparam: @@||example.org^$removeparam negates all $removeparam rules for URLs that match ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$removeparam=param negates the rule with $removeparam=param for any request matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$removeparam=/regexp/ negates the rule with $removeparam=/regexp/ for any request matching ||example.org^. Multiple rules matching a single request In the case when multiple $removeparam rules match a single request, each of them will be applied one by one.

Restrictions Rules with $removeparam modifier can be used only in trusted filters.$removeparam rules are compatible with basic modifiers, content-type modifiers, and with $important and $app modifiers. Rules with any other modifiers are considered invalid and will be discarded. Compatibility Rules with $removeparam modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android and AdGuard Browser Extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.$removeparam syntax for regular expressions is supported by AdGuard Browser Extension v4.0 and AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.8 or later.POST request types are supported only by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. $replace​ This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied, the rule will not block the request. The response is going to be modified instead. You will need some knowledge of regular expressions to use $replace modifier. Features $replace rules apply to any text response, but will not apply to binary (media, image, object, etc.).$replace rules do not apply if the size of the original response is more than 3MB.$replace rules have a higher priority than other basic rules (including exception rules). So if a request corresponds to two different rules one of which has the $replace modifier, this rule will be applied.Document-level exception rules with $content or $document modifiers do disable $replace rules for requests matching them.Other document-level exception rules ($generichide, $elemhide or $jsinject modifiers) are applied alongside $replace rules. It means that you can modify the page content with a $replace rule and disable cosmetic rules there at the same time. $replace value can be empty in the case of exception rules. See examples section for further information. Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $replace rules match a single request, we will apply each of them. The order is defined alphabetically. Syntax In general, $replace syntax is similar to replacement with regular expressions in Perl. replace = &quot;/&quot; regexp &quot;/&quot; replacement &quot;/&quot; modifiers  regexp — a regular expression.replacement — a string that will be used to replace the string corresponding to regexp.modifiers — a regular expression flags. For example, i — insensitive search, or s — single-line mode. In the $replace value, two characters must be escaped: comma , and dollar sign $. Use backslash \\ for it. For example, an escaped comma looks like this: \\,. Examples ||example.org^$replace=/(&lt;VAST[\\s\\S]*?&gt;)[\\s\\S]*&lt;\\/VAST&gt;/\\$1&lt;\\/VAST&gt;/i  There are three parts in this rule: regexp — (&lt;VAST(.|\\s)*?&gt;)(.|\\s)*&lt;\\/VAST&gt;;replacement — \\$1&lt;\\/VAST&gt; where $ is escaped;modifiers — i for insensitive search. You can see how this rule works here: http://regexr.com/3cesk Multiple $replace rules ||example.org^$replace=/X/Y/||example.org^$replace=/Z/Y/@@||example.org/page/*$replace=/Z/Y/ Both rule 1 and 2 will be applied to all requests sent to example.org.Rule 2 is disabled for requests matching ||example.org/page/, but rule 1 still works! Disabling $replace rules @@||example.org^$replace will disable all $replace rules matching ||example.org^.@@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$content will disable all $replace rules originated from pages of example.org including the page itself. Restrictions Rules with $replace modifier can be used only in trusted filters. Compatibility Rules with $replace modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android and AdGuard Browser Extension for Firefox. Such rules do not work in extensions for other browsers because they are unable to modify content on the network level. noop​ noop modifier does nothing and can be used solely to increase rules' readability. It consists of a sequence of underscore characters (_) of any length and can appear in a rule as many times as needed. Examples ||example.com$_,removeparam=/^ss\\\\$/,_,image ||example.com$replace=/bad/good/,___,~third-party  Compatibility Rules with noop modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $empty (deprecated)​ Deprecation notice This modifier is deprecated in favor of the $redirect modifier. Rules with $empty are still supported and being converted into $redirect=nooptext now but the support shall be removed in the future. Usually, blocked requests look like a server error to browser. If you use $empty modifier, AdGuard will emulate a blank response from the server with200 OK status. Examples ||example.org^$empty returns an empty response to all requests to example.org and all subdomains. Compatibility Rules with $empty modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $mp4 (deprecated)​ Deprecation notice This modifier is deprecated in favor of the $redirect modifier. Rules with $mp4 are still supported and being converted into $redirect=noopmp4-1s,media now but the support shall be removed in the future. As a response to blocked request AdGuard returns a short video placeholder.

"},{"title":"Rule priorities​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#rule-priorities","content":"Each rule has its own priority, which is necessary when several rules match the request and the filtering engine needs to select one of them. Priority is measured by a positive integer. Collisions When two rules with the same priority match the same request, it depends on the filtering engine implementation which one will be selected. info The concept of rule priorities becomes increasingly important in light of Manifest V3 as the existing rules need to be converted to declarativeNetRequest rules. Priority computation​ To calculate priority, we've categorized modifiers into different groups. These groups are ranked based on their priority, from lowest to highest. A modifier that significantly narrows the scope of a rule adds more weight to its total priority. Conversely, if a rule applies to a broader range of requests, its priority decreases. It's worth noting that there are cases where a single-parameter modifier has a higher priority than multi-parameter ones. For instance, in the case of $domain=example.com|example.org, a rule that includes two domains has a slightly broader effective area than a rule with one specified domain, therefore its priority is lower. The base priority of any rule is 1. If the calculated priority is a floating-point number, it will be rounded up to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the calculated priority. Compatibility The concept of priority has been introduced in tsurlfilter v2.1.0 and CoreLibs v1.13. Before that AdGuard didn't have any special priority computation algorithm and collisions handling could be different depending on AdGuard product and version.AdGuard for iOS, Safari, and AdGuard Content Blocker rely on the browsers implementation and they cannot follow the rules specified here. note Modifier aliases (1p, 3p, etc.) are not included in these categories, however, they are utilized within the engine to compute the rule priority. Basic modifiers, the presence of each adds 1 to the priority​ $app with negated applications using ~,$denyallow,$dnsrewrite,$domain with negated domains using ~,$match-case,$method with negated methods using ~,$third-party,$to,restricted content-types with ~. When dealing with a negated domain, app, method, or content-type, we add 1 point for the existence of the modifier itself, regardless of the quantity of negated domains or content-types. This is because the rule's scope is already infinitely broad. Put simply, by prohibiting multiple domains, content-types, methods or apps, the scope of the rule becomes only minimally smaller. Defined content-type modifiers, defined methods, defined headers, $popup, special exceptions​ All allowed content types: $document,$font,$image,$media,$object,$other,$ping,$script,$stylesheet,$subdocument,$websocket,$xmlhttprequest; This also includes rules that implicitly add the modifier $document: $popup; Or special exceptions that implicitly add $document,subdocument: $content,$elemhide,$extension,$genericblock,$generichide,$jsinject,$specifichide,$urlblock; Or allowed methods via $method. Or rules with $header. The presence of any content-type modifiers adds (50 + 50 / N), where N is the number of modifiers present, for example: ||example.com^$image,script will add 50 + 50 / 2 = 50 + 25 = 75 to the total weight of the rule. The $popup also belongs to this category, because it implicitly adds the modifier $document. Similarly, specific exceptions add $document,subdocument. If there is a $method modifier in the rule with allowed methods it adds (50 + 50 / N), where N is the number of methods allowed, for example: ||example.com^$method=GET|POST|PUT will add 50 + 50 / 3 = 50 + 16.6 = 67 to the total weight of the rule. If there is a $header modifier in the rule it adds 50. $domain or $app with allowed domains or applications​ Specified domains through $domain or specified applications through $app add 100 + 100 / N, where N is the number of modifier values for example: ||example.com^$domain=example.com|example.org|example.net will add 100 + 100 / 3 = 134.3 = 135 or ||example.com^$app=org.example.app1|org.example.app2 will add 100 + 100 / 2 = 151 or ||example.com^$domain=example.com,app=org.example.app1|org.example.app2 will add 100 + 100/1 ($domain part) and 100 + 100/2 ($app part), totaling 350. Modifier values that are regexps or tld will be interpreted as normal entries of the form example.com and counted one by one, for example: ||example.com^$domain=example.* will add 100 + 100 / 1 = 200 or ||example.com^$domain=example.*|adguard.* will add 100 + 100 / 2 = 150. $redirect rules​ $redirect,$redirect-rule. Each of which adds 10^3 to rule priority. Specific exceptions​ $content,$elemhide,$extension,$genericblock,$generichide,$jsinject,$specifichide,$urlblock; Each of which adds 10^4 to the priority. As well as exception with $document modifier: because it's an alias for $elemhide,content,jsinject,urlblock,extension. It will add 10^4 for each modifier from the top list, 10^4 * 5 in total. In addition, each of these exceptions implicitly adds the two allowed content-type modifiers $document,subdocument. Allowlist rules​ Modifier @@ adds 10^5 to rule priority. $important rules​ Modifier $important adds 10^6 to rule priority. Rules for which there is no priority weight​ Other modifiers, which are supposed to perform additional post- or pre-processing of requests, do not add anything to the rules priority. note The $replace modifier takes precedence over all blocking rules of categories 1-3, as well as exception rules from categories 3-5, except $content, because an exception with the $content modifier overrides all $replace rules.

If you want to limit the rule application area to certain domains, just enter them separated with commas. For example: example.org,example.com##selector. This rule will be also applied to all subdomains of example.org and example.com. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain domains, start a domain name with ~ sign. For example: ~example.org##selector. You can use both approaches in a single rule. For example, example.org,~subdomain.example.org##domain will work for example.org and all subdomains, except subdomain.example.org. note Element hiding rules are not dependent on each other. If there is a rule example.org##selector in the filter and you add ~example.org##selector both rules will be applied independently. Examples example.com##div.textad — hides a div with a class textad at example.com and all subdomains.example.com,example.org###adblock — hides an element with attribute id equals adblock at example.com, example.org and all subdomains.~example.com##.textad — hides an element with a class textad at all domains, except example.com and its subdomains. 제한 Safari does not support both permitted and restricted domains. So the rules like example.org,~foo.example.org##.textad are invalid in AdGuard for Safari. Exceptions Exceptions can disable some rules on particular domains. They are very similar to usual exception rules, but instead of ## you have to use #@#. For example, there is a rule in filter: ##.textad  If you want to disable it for example.com, you can create an exception rule: example.com#@#.textad  Sometimes, it may be necessary to disable all restriction rules. For example, to conduct tests. To do this, use the exclusion rule without specifying a domain. It will completely disable matching CSS elemhide rule on ALL domains: #@#.textad  The same can be achieved by adding this rule: *#@#.textad  We recommend to use this kind of exceptions only if it is not possible to change the hiding rule itself. In other cases it is better to change the original rule, using domain restrictions.

To solve this problem AdGuard extends CSS capabilities by adding support for the new pseudo-elements. We have developed a separate open-source library for non-standard element selecting and applying CSS styles with extended properties. The idea of extended capabilities is an opportunity to match DOM elements with selectors based on their own representation (style, text content, etc.) or relations with other elements. There is also an opportunity to apply styles with non-standard CSS properties. Application area Extended selectors can be used in any cosmetic rule, whether they are element hiding rules or CSS rules. Compatibility Rules with extended CSS selectors are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. Syntax Regardless of the CSS pseudo-classes you are using in the rule, you can use special markers to force applying these rules by ExtendedCss. It is recommended to use these markers for all extended CSS cosmetic rules so that it was easier to find them. The syntax for extended CSS rules: #?# — for element hiding, #@?# — for exceptions#$?# — for CSS rules, #@$?# — for exceptions We strongly recommend using these markers any time when you use an extended CSS selector. Examples example.org#?#div:has(&gt; a[target=&quot;_blank&quot;][rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;]) — this rule blocks all div elements containing a child node that has a link with the attributes [target=&quot;_blank&quot;][rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;]. The rule applies only to example.org and its subdomains.example.com#$?#h3:contains(cookies) { display: none!important; } — this rule sets the style display: none!important to all h3 elements that contain the word cookies. The rule applies only to example.com and all its subdomains.example.net#?#.banner:matches-css(width: 360px) — this rule blocks all .banner elements with the style property width: 360px. The rule applies only to example.net and its subdomains.example.net#@?#.banner:matches-css(width: 360px) — this rule will disable the previous rule. You can apply standard CSS selectors using the ExtendedCss library by using a rule marker #?#, e.g. #?#div.banner. Learn more about how to debug extended selectors. note Some pseudo-classes do not require selector before it. Still adding a universal selector * makes an extended selector easier to read, even though it has no effect on the matching behavior. So selector #block :has(&gt; .inner) works exactly like #block *:has(&gt; .inner) but second one is more obvious. Pseudo-class names are case-insensitive, e.g. :HAS() works as :has(). Still the lower-case names are used commonly. ExtendedCss Limitations​ CSS comments and at-rules are not supported. Specific pseudo-class may have its own limitations: :has(), :xpath(), :nth-ancestor(), :upward(), :is(), :not(), and :remove(). Pseudo-class :has()​ Draft CSS 4.0 specification describes the :has() pseudo-class. Unfortunately, it is not yet supported by all popular browsers. note Rules with the :has() pseudo-class should use the native implementation of :has() if they use ## marker and if it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying of ExtendedCss rules with :has(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. Compatibility with other pseudo-classes Synonyms :-abp-has() is supported by ExtendedCss for better compatibility. Removal notice :if() is no longer supported as a synonym for :has(). Syntax [target]:has(selector)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementselector — required, standard or extended CSS selector The pseudo-class :has() selects the target elements that fit to the selector. Also the selector can start with a combinator. A selector list can be set in selector as well. In this case all selectors in the list are being matched for now. In the future it will be fixed for &lt;forgiving-relative-selector-list&gt; as argument. :has() limitations​ Usage of the :has() pseudo-class is restricted for some cases (2, 3): disallow :has() inside the pseudos accepting only compound selectors;disallow :has() after regular pseudo-elements. Native :has() pseudo-class does not allow :has(), :is(), :where() inside :has() argument to avoid increasing the :has() invalidation complexity (case 1). But ExtendedCss did not have such limitation earlier and filter lists already contain such rules, so we have not added this limitation to ExtendedCss and allow to use :has() inside :has() as it was possible before. To use it, just force ExtendedCss usage by setting #?#/#$?# rule marker. Native implementation does not allow any usage of :scope inside :has() argument ([1], [2]). Still, there are some such rules in filter lists: div:has(:scope a) which we continue to support by simply converting them to div:has(&gt; a), as it used to be done previously. Examples div:has(.banner) selects all div elements which include an element with the banner class: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected &lt;span class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;inner element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  div:has(&gt; .banner) selects all div elements which include an banner class element as a direct child of div: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;child element&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  div:has(+ .banner) selects all div elements preceding banner class element which immediately follows the div and both are children of the same parent: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;adjacent sibling&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Not selected&lt;/span&gt;  div:has(~ .banner) selects all div elements preceding banner class element which follows the div but not necessarily immediately and both are children of the same parent: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span&gt;Not selected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;general sibling&lt;/p&gt;  div:has(span, .banner) selects all div elements which include both span element and banner class element: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Selected &lt;span&gt;child span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;child .banner&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :has() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :contains()​ The :contains() pseudo-class principle is very simple: it allows to select the elements that contain specified text or which content matches a specified regular expression. Regexp flags are supported. note The :contains() pseudo-class uses the textContent element property for matching, not the innerHTML. Compatibility with other pseudo-classes Synonyms :-abp-contains() and :has-text() are supported for better compatibility. Syntax [target]:contains(match)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementmatch — required, string or regular expression for matching element textContent. Regular expression flags are supported. Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;match&quot;&gt;Selected as IT contains &quot;banner&quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not selected &lt;div class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  the element div#match can be selected by any on these extended selectors: ! plain text div:contains(banner) ! regular expression div:contains(/as .* banner/) ! regular expression with flags div:contains(/it .* banner/gi)  note Only the div with id=match is selected because the next element does not contain any text, and banner is a part of code, not a text. Old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :contains() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :matches-css()​ The :matches-css() pseudo-class allows to match the element by its current style properties. The work of the pseudo-class is based on using the Window.getComputedStyle() method. Syntax [target]:matches-css([pseudo-element, ] property: pattern)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementpseudo-element — optional, valid standard pseudo-element, e.g. before, after, first-line, etc.property — required, a name of CSS property to check the element forpattern — required, a value pattern that is using the same simple wildcard matching as in the basic url filtering rules OR a regular expression. For this type of matching, AdGuard always does matching in a case-insensitive manner. In the case of a regular expression, the pattern looks like /regexp/. Special characters escaping and unescaping For non-regexp patterns (,),[,] must be unescaped, e.g. :matches-css(background-image:url(data:*)). For regexp patterns \\ should be escaped, e.g. :matches-css(background-image: /^url\\\\(&quot;data:image\\\\/gif;base64.+/). Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; #matched::before { content: &quot;Block me&quot; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;matched&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;not-matched&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  the div elements with pseudo-element ::before and with specified content property can be selected by any of these extended selectors: ! string pattern div:matches-css(before, content: block me) ! string pattern with wildcard div:matches-css(before, content: block*) ! regular expression pattern div:matches-css(before, content: /block me/)  Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Compatibility Obsolete pseudo-classes :matches-css-before() and :matches-css-after() are no longer recommended but still are supported for better compatibility. Old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :matches-css() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :matches-attr()​ The :matches-attr() pseudo-class allows to select an element by its attributes, especially if they are randomized. Syntax [target]:matches-attr(&quot;name&quot;[=&quot;value&quot;])  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementname — required, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for attribute name matchingvalue — optional, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for attribute value matching Escaping special characters For regexp patterns &quot; and \\ should be escaped, e.g. div:matches-attr(class=/[\\\\w]{5}/). Examples div:matches-attr(&quot;ad-link&quot;) selects the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; ad-link=&quot;1random23-banner_240x400&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  div:matches-attr(&quot;data-*&quot;=&quot;adBanner&quot;) selects the element div#target2: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot; data-1random23=&quot;adBanner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  div:matches-attr(*unit*=/^click$/) selects the element div#target3: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target3&quot; random123-unit094=&quot;click&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  *:matches-attr(&quot;/.{5,}delay$/&quot;=&quot;/^[0-9]*$/&quot;) selects the element #target4: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;inner-random23 id=&quot;target4&quot; nt4f5be90delay=&quot;1000&quot;&gt;&lt;/inner-random23&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Pseudo-class :matches-property()​ The :matches-property() pseudo-class allows to select an element by matching its properties. Syntax [target]:matches-property(&quot;name&quot;[=&quot;value&quot;])  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementname — required, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for element property name matchingvalue — optional, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for element property value matching Escaping special characters For regexp patterns &quot; and \\ should be escaped, e.g. div:matches-property(prop=/[\\\\w]{4}/). note Regexp patterns are supported in name for any property in chain, e.g. prop./^unit[\\\\d]{4}$/.type. Examples An element with such properties: divProperties = { id: 1, check: { track: true, unit_2random1: true, }, memoizedProps: { key: null, tag: 12, _owner: { effectTag: 1, src: 'ad.com', }, }, };  can be selected by any of these extended selectors: div:matches-property(check.track) div:matches-property(&quot;check./^unit_.{4,8}$/&quot;) div:matches-property(&quot;check.unit_*&quot;=true) div:matches-property(memoizedProps.key=&quot;null&quot;) div:matches-property(memoizedProps._owner.src=/ad/)  For filters maintainers To check properties of a specific element, do the following: Inspect the page element or select it in Elements tab of browser DevTools.Run console.dir($0) in Console tab. Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Pseudo-class :xpath()​ The :xpath() pseudo-class allows to select an element by evaluating an XPath expression. Syntax [target]:xpath(expression)  target- optional, standard or extended CSS selectorexpression — required, valid XPath expression :xpath() limitations​ target can be omitted so it is optional. For any other pseudo-class that would mean &quot;apply to all DOM nodes&quot;, but in case of :xpath() it just means &quot;apply to the whole document&quot;, and such applying slows elements selecting significantly. That's why rules like #?#:xpath(expression) are limited to looking inside the body tag. For example, rule #?#:xpath(//div[@data-st-area=\\'Advert\\']) is parsed as #?#body:xpath(//div[@data-st-area=\\'Advert\\']). Extended selectors with defined target as any selector — *:xpath(expression) — can still be used but it is not recommended, so target should be specified instead. Works properly only at the end of selector, except for pseudo-class :remove(). Examples :xpath(//*[@class=&quot;banner&quot;]) selects the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  :xpath(//*[@class=&quot;inner&quot;]/..) selects the element div#target2: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Pseudo-class :nth-ancestor()​ The :nth-ancestor() pseudo-class allows to lookup the nth ancestor relative to the previously selected element. subject:nth-ancestor(n)  subject — required, standard or extended CSS selectorn — required, number &gt;= 1 and &lt; 256, distance to the needed ancestor from the element selected by subject Syntax subject:nth-ancestor(n)  subject — required, standard or extended CSS selectorn — required, number &gt;= 1 and &lt; 256, distance to the needed ancestor from the element selected by subject :nth-ancestor() limitations​ The :nth-ancestor() pseudo-class is not supported inside the argument of the :not() pseudo-class. Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  .child:nth-ancestor(1) selects the element div#target1, div[class=&quot;inner&quot;]:nth-ancestor(3) selects the element div#target2. Pseudo-class :upward()​ The :upward() pseudo-class allows to lookup the ancestor relative to the previously selected element. Syntax subject:upward(ancestor)  subject — required, standard or extended CSS selectorancestor — required, specification for the ancestor of the element selected by subject, can be set as: number &gt;= 1 and &lt; 256 for distance to the needed ancestor, same as :nth-ancestor()standard CSS selector for matching closest ancestor :upward() limitations​ The :upward() pseudo-class is not supported inside the argument of the :not() pseudo-class. Examples For such DOM: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; data=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  .inner:upward(div[data]) selects the element div#target1, .inner:upward(div[id]) selects the element div#target2, .child:upward(1) selects the element div#target1, .inner:upward(3) selects the element div#target2. Pseudo-class :remove() and pseudo-property remove​ Sometimes, it is necessary to remove a matching element instead of hiding it or applying custom styles. In order to do it, you can use the :remove() pseudo-class as well as the remove pseudo-property. Pseudo-class :remove() can be placed only at the end of a selector. Syntax ! pseudo-class selector:remove() ! pseudo-property selector { remove: true; }  selector — required, standard or extended CSS selector :remove() and remove limitations​ The :remove() pseudo-class is limited to work properly only at the end of selector. For applying the :remove() pseudo-class to any element, a universal selector * should be used. Otherwise such extended selector may be considered as invalid, e.g. .banner &gt; :remove() is not valid for removing any child element of banner class element, so it should look like .banner &gt; *:remove(). If the :remove() pseudo-class or the remove pseudo-property is used, all style properties are ignored except for the debug pseudo-property. Examples div.banner:remove() div:has(&gt; div[ad-attr]):remove() div:contains(advertisement) { remove: true; } div[class]:has(&gt; a &gt; img) { remove: true; }  note Rules with the remove pseudo-property should use #$?# marker: $ for CSS style rules syntax, ? for ExtendedCss syntax. Pseudo-class :is()​ The :is() pseudo-class allows to match any element that can be selected by any of selectors passed to it. Invalid selectors are skipped and the pseudo-class deals with valid ones with no error thrown. Our implementation of the native :is() pseudo-class. Syntax [target]:is(selectors)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementselectors — forgiving selector list of standard or extended selectors. For extended selectors only compound selectors are supported, not complex. :is() limitations​ Rules with the :is() pseudo-class should use the native implementation of :is() if rules use ## marker and it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying ExtendedCss rules with :is(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. If the :is() pseudo-class argument selectors is an extended selector, due to the way how the :is() pseudo-class is implemented in ExtendedCss v2.0, it is impossible to apply it to the top DOM node which is html, i.e. #?#html:is(&lt;extended-selectors&gt;) does not work. So if target is not defined or defined as a universal selector *, the extended pseudo-class applying is limited to html's children, e.g. rules #?#:is(...) and #?#*:is(...) are parsed as #?#html *:is(...). Please note that there is no such limitation for a standard selector argument, i.e. #?#html:is(.locked) works fine. Complex selectors with extended pseudo-classes are not supported as selectors argument for :is() pseudo-class, only compound ones are allowed. Check examples below for more details. Examples #container *:is(.inner, .footer) selects only the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt; &lt;div data=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot; class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Due to limitations :is(*:not([class]) &gt; .banner)' does not work but :is(*:not([class]):has(&gt; .banner)) can be used instead of it to select the element div#target2: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;span&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target2&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;inner paragraph&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Pseudo-class :not()​ The :not() pseudo-class allows to select elements which are not matched by selectors passed as argument. Invalid argument selectors are not allowed and error is to be thrown. Our implementation of the :not() pseudo-class. Syntax [target]:not(selectors)  target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any elementselectors — list of standard or extended selectors :not() limitations​ Rules with the :not() pseudo-class should use the native implementation of :not() if rules use ## marker and it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying ExtendedCss rules with :not(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. If the :not() pseudo-class argument selectors is an extended selector, due to the way how the :not() pseudo-class is implemented in ExtendedCss v2.0, it is impossible to apply it to the top DOM node which is html, i.e. #?#html:not(&lt;extended-selectors&gt;) does not work. So if target is not defined or defined as a universal selector *, the extended pseudo-class applying is limited to html's children, e.g. rules #?#:not(...) and #?#*:not(...) are parsed as #?#html *:not(...). Please note that there is no such limitation for a standard selector argument, i.e. #?#html:not(.locked) works fine. The :not() is considered as a standard CSS pseudo-class inside the argument of the :upward() pseudo-class because :upward() supports only standard selectors. &quot;Up-looking&quot; pseudo-classes which are :nth-ancestor() and :upward() are not supported inside selectors argument for :not() pseudo-class. Examples #container &gt; *:not(h2, .text) selects only the element div#target1: &lt;!-- HTML code --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Header&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;target1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Pseudo-class :if-not() (removed)​ Removal notice The :if-not() pseudo-class is removed and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. This pseudo-class was basically a shortcut for :not(:has()). It was supported by ExtendedCss for better compatibility with some filters subscriptions.

Please note that hints will be applied to registered filters only. The filter is considered to be registered and known by AdGuard, if it is present in the known filters index. If you want your filter to be registered, please file an issue to AdguardFilters repo. "},{"title":"Preprocessor directives​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to create your own ad filters","url":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#preprocessor-directives","content":"We provide preprocessor directives that can be used by filters maintainers to improve compatibility with different ad blockers and provide: including a fileapplying rules conditionally by ad blocker typecontent blocker specifying for rules applying in Safari note Any mistake in a preprocessor directive will lead to AdGuard failing the filter update in the same way as if the filter URL was unavailable. Preprocessor directives can be used in the user rules or in the custom filters. Including a file​ The !#include directive allows to include contents of a specified file into the filter. It supports only files from the same origin to make sure that the filter maintainer is in control of the specified file. The included file can also contain pre- directives (even other !#include directives). Ad blockers should consider the case of recursive !#include and implement a protection mechanism. Syntax !#include file_path  where file_path is a same origin absolute or relative file path to be included. The files must originate from the same domain but may be located in a different folder. If included file is not found or unavailable, the whole filter update should fail. Same-origin limitation should be disabled for local custom filters. Examples Filter URL: https://example.org/path/filter.txt ! Valid (same origin): !#include https://example.org/path/includedfile.txt ! ! Valid (relative path): !#include /includedfile.txt !#include ../path2/includedfile.txt ! ! Invalid (another origin): !#include https://domain.com/path/includedfile.txt  Conditions​ Filters maintainers can use conditions to supply different rules depending on the ad blocker type. When an adblocker encounters an !#if directive, followed eventually by an !#endif directive, it will compile the code inside of the directives block only if the specified condition is true. Condition supports all the basic logical operators. A conditional directive beginning with an !#if directive must explicitly be terminated with an !#endif directive. Whitespaces matter. !#if is a valid directive, while !# if is not. Syntax !#if (conditions) rules_list !#endif  where: !#if (conditions) — start of the blockconditions — just like in some popular programming languages, preprocessor conditions are based on constants declared by ad blockers. Ad blocker authors define on their own what exact constants do they declare. Possible values: adguard always declared; shows maintainers that this is one of AdGuard products; should be enough in 95% of casesproduct-specific constants for cases when you need a rule to work (or not work — then ! should be used before constant) in a specific product only: adguard_app_windows — AdGuard for Windowsadguard_app_mac — AdGuard for Macadguard_app_android — AdGuard for Androidadguard_app_ios — AdGuard for iOSadguard_ext_safari — AdGuard for Safariadguard_ext_chromium — AdGuard Browser Extension for Chrome (and chromium-based browsers, e.g. new Microsoft Edge)adguard_ext_firefox — AdGuard Browser Extension for Firefoxadguard_ext_edge — AdGuard Browser Extension for Edge Legacyadguard_ext_opera — AdGuard Browser Extension for Operaadguard_ext_android_cb — AdGuard Content Blocker for mobile Samsung and Yandex browsersext_ublock — special case; this one is declared when a uBlock version of a filter is compiled by the FiltersRegistry rules_list — list of rules!#endif — end of the block Examples ! for all AdGuard products except AdGuard for Safari !#if (adguard &amp;&amp; !adguard_ext_safari) ||example.org^$third-party domain.com##div.ad !#endif  ! directives even can be combined !#if (adguard_app_android) !#include /androidspecific.txt !#endif  Safari affinity​ Safari's limit for each content blocker is 150,000 active rules. But in AdGuard for Safari and AdGuard for iOS, we've split the rules into 6 content blockers, thus increasing the rule limit to 900,000. Here is the composition of each content blocker: AdGuard General — Ad Blocking, Language-specificAdGuard Privacy — PrivacyAdGuard Social — Social Widgets, AnnoyancesAdGuard Security — SecurityAdGuard Other — OtherAdGuard Custom — Custom User rules and allowlist are added to every content blocker. caution The main disadvantage of using multiple content blockers is that rules from different blockers are applied independently. Blocking rules are not affected by this, but unblocking rules may cause problems. If a blocking rule is in one content blocker and an exception is in another, the exception will not work. Filter maintainers use !#safari_cb_affinity to define Safari content blocker affinity for the rules inside of the directive block. Syntax !#safari_cb_affinity(content_blockers) rules_list !#safari_cb_affinity  where: !#safari_cb_affinity(content_blockers) — start of the blockcontent_blockers — comma-separated list of content blockers.

Syntax !+ HINT_NAME1(PARAMS) HINT_NAME2(PARAMS)  Multiple hints can be applied. NOT_OPTIMIZED hint​ For each filter, AdGuard compiles two versions: full and optimized. Optimized version is much more lightweight and does not contain rules which are not used at all or used rarely. Rules usage frequency comes from the collected filter rules statistics. But filters optimization is based on more than that — some filters have specific configuration. This is how it looks like for Base filter: &quot;filter&quot;: AdGuard Base filter, &quot;percent&quot;: 30, &quot;minPercent&quot;: 20, &quot;maxPercent&quot;: 40, &quot;strict&quot;: true  where: filter — filter identifierpercent — expected optimization percent ~= (rules count in optimized filter) / (rules count in original filter) * 100minPercent — lower bound of percent valuemaxPercent — upper bound of percent valuestrict — if percent &lt; minPercent OR percent &gt; maxPercent and strict mode is on then filter compilation should fail, otherwise original rules must be used In other words, percent is the &quot;compression level&quot;. For instance, for the Base filter it is configured to 40%. It means that optimization algorithm should strip 60% of rules.

In order to do it without interacting with JavaScript directly, you can use a special debug style property. When ExtendedCss meets this property, it enables the debugging mode either for a single selector or for all selectors, depending on the debug value. Open the browser console while on a web page to see the timing statistics for selector(s) that were applied there. Debugging mode displays the following stats as object where each of the debugged selectors are keys, and value is an object with such properties: Always printed: selectorParsed — text of eventually parsed selectortimings — list of DOM nodes matched by the selector appliesCount — total number of times that the selector has been applied on the pageappliesTimings — time that it took to apply the selector on the page, for each of the instances that it has been applied (in milliseconds)meanTiming — mean time that it took to apply the selector on the pagestandardDeviation — standard deviationtimingsSum — total time it took to apply the selector on the page across all instances Printed only for remove pseudos: removed — flag to signal if elements we removed Printed if elements are not removed: matchedElements — list of DOM nodes matched by the selectorstyleApplied — parsed rule style declaration related to the selector Examples Debugging a single selector: When the value of the debug property is true, only information about this selector will be shown in the browser console. #$?#.banner { display: none; debug: true; }  Enabling global debug: When the value of the debug property is global, the console will display information about all extended CSS selectors that have matches on the current page, for all the rules from any of the enabled filters. #$?#.banner { display: none; debug: global; }  Testing extended selectors without AdGuard ExtendedCss can be executed on any page without using any AdGuard product. In order to do that you should copy and execute the following code in a browser console: !function(e,t,d){C=e.createElement(t),C.src=d,C.onload=function(){alert(&quot;ExtendedCss loaded successfully&quot;)},s=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],s?s.parentNode.insertBefore(C,s):(h=e.getElementsByTagName(&quot;head&quot;)[0],h.appendChild(C))}(document,&quot;script&quot;,&quot;https://AdguardTeam.github.io/ExtendedCss/extended-css.min.js&quot;);  Alternatively, install the ExtendedCssDebugger userscript.

It will not only save your time and effort, but also ensure that we are on the same page in terms of the meaning of phrases being translated. Once you open our page on Crowdin, choose any project you need and select your language. You'll also be able to switch between languages even after opening certain product folders. Choose any of available product folders and select a file — now you can start translating. note You can also change the Crowdin interface language by clicking the Settings icon in the top right corner of the page. In the opened window scroll down to the UI language tab. Open it, choose a language and click Change. The following guidelines will help you through the process. You can filter translations by clicking this button and selecting any offered option. Easily move between the files of the project. Pay attention to the glossary terms highlighted with a dotted line in a source phrase. Usually, they are special words (like brand names) that should not be translated. You can suggest your translation for translatable terms in the AdGuard Glossary project. In Crowdin, strings can have notes that make it easier to understand and translate phrases. Look for them in the &quot;Context&quot; field of the source string. Pay attention to screenshots that often go alongside source phrases in the &quot;Context&quot; field as well. They help to understand the context and convey the exact meaning. tip You can request context by clicking the &quot;REQUEST&quot; button. ::: ![crowdin *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/request.png) In addition to suggesting new translations, you can also leave comments on strings. Use comments to let us know about mistakes in the existing translations, make notes, or ask questions. If you see a comment left on your translation — try to respond to it. There's also a Discussions tab on the main project page that conveniently allows you to see all the comments for the specific language in this project. Crowdin provides a very useful and convenient tool called Translation Memory. With its help, you can find the previously made translations of the same words and phrases and reuse them in your translations. Once you join a project by clicking the &quot;Join&quot; button, you will see the Tasks tab on the project page, where the tasks for specific project files get created. Please pay attention to them: they usually have a higher priority. Sometimes you can find phrases with plural forms. Please be especially attentive when translating such phrases. You can read how to translate plural forms here. Using proper plural forms is extremely important: please ask us in the comments if anything is unclear. Please do not write directly to the project managers and proofreaders listed in the Project info.

Their usage depends on the number of things you are talking about. For instance, English words have two word forms when speaking about something in the singular, like 'one star', and in the plural — 'two stars'. It doesn’t matter if you say five, twenty six or even five hundred thirty two stars — the ending 's' will remain the same. But some languages can contain only one or many plural forms. In contrast to English, the Polish language has three plural forms of nouns. One of them is used when speaking about something in the singular, another form is used in the plural but with numbers ending in 2-4, excluding 12-14, and the third form — for words with other numbers in front of them. Let’s take a look at this picture. Here you can see the groups of numerals which determine a word form when standing in front of it.  Let’s draw a small parallel between English and Polish for better understanding:  The English version: The Polish equivalents: 1. form - It takes one hour. 1. form - Zajmuje to godzinę. 2. form - It takes two hours. 2. form - Zajmuje to dwie godziny. 3. form - It takes five hours. 3. form - Zajmuje to pięć godzin.  Now it is clear that the Polish 'godzinę' (hour) has three different forms, whereas the English word changes its form with given numbers only twice. Except for Polish, there are a lot of other languages that have three plural forms and more, such as Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Czech etc. But not all of them obey the same rule. That's why it is so important to know how many plural forms your language contains and how you can apply them. "},{"title":"Where can you learn about the number of plural forms?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Plural forms","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#where-to-learn","content":"When you are faced with a translation that requires the use of plurals, you may not be able to realize right away how many word forms your language contains. Here are some sources of information you can use. Localization Guide contains a wide list of languages. The number of plural forms for different languages is shown this way: 'nplurals=2', 'nplurals=4' and so on. The numeral after the Equals sign '=' means the number of plural forms of the respective language. Also, you can get information about plural forms in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR). The CLDR Plural Rules indicate an additional word form for decimal numbers (1.5; 2.3; 100.1…), but we don’t use them in AdGuard translations. "},{"title":"Plurals in AdGuard translations​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Plural forms","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#translations","content":"First of all, we want to mention that not every AdGuard translation requires the use of plural forms.

Please look at the example:  If there are 3 plural forms of nouns in your language (like in Polish), please write all plural forms separated by commas. hour, hours — godzinę, godziny, godzin In case a noun has only 2 forms, there is no need to write the same form twice (typically only for this type of strings with plurals!). However, it won't be a mistake if you repeat the form twice. "},{"title":"3. Strings that use the Crowdin-developed pattern​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Plural forms","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#3type","content":"This is the most user-friendly scheme of translating strings with plurals. Crowdin suggests to users that they translate the certain amount of phrases with different plural forms. If your language provides only one plural form, then you will see only one phrase to translate. If three or more forms, Crowdin will provide you with the string divided into other two or three strings to translate. For example:  Please be attentive when translating these strings and approving them. If you have no idea what the &quot;Other&quot; field means, then just paste the same form as it is in the &quot;Many&quot; field. The translations of &quot;Many&quot; and &quot;Other&quot; fields can be the same. "},{"title":"4. Strings with templates separated by the vertical bar sign​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Plural forms","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#4type","content":"This is the most complicated type of AdGuard strings which is mostly used in AdGuard Websites project. Pay close attention to a vertical bar sign between the sentences and %count% placeholders in original phrases — this will help you identify phrases where translations require the use of plural forms.  Now, let’s imagine — you are faced with such a string: Standard license for %count% computer | Standard license for %count% computers. What should you know to translate it correctly? Let's call the sentences which are divided by a vertical bar sign &quot;templates&quot;, because actually they serve as templates for phrases with different numbers. Coming back to the example, as the English language includes only two forms, there should be two templates respectively: Standard license for *%count%* computer | Standard license for *%count%* computers where template 1 is Standard license for %count% computer, and template 2 is Standard license for %count% computers Another important thing you should pay your attention to is %count% placeholders that, as usual, take place before the words they define. Instead of %count% here will appear different numbers depending on which templates are being chosen. In a situation with another language that has, let’s say, three plural forms, there should be three templates with two vertical bar signs between them. For example, when we translate the above mentioned phrase into Slovak, that according to the rule of Localization Guide has three word forms, the correct translation will look so: **Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítač | Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítače | Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítačov**  In this case, we see three templates which contain three forms of the word &quot;počítač&quot; (computer) in Slovak. If we ignore one of the forms and use only two templates for Slovak instead of three, the system won’t be able to take an appropriate template for certain numbers and, as a result, we will have grammar mistakes in sentences, like in English: Standard license for 5 computer. Always use as many forms as there are in your language, even when the word itself has fewer word forms. For example, the Serbian word 'računar' (computer) has only two forms. But there are 3 plural forms in Serbian.  Thus, the translation from English into Serbian should be: **Standardna licenca za *%count%* računar | Standardna licenca za *%count%* računara | Standardna licenca za *%count%* računara** Although it is obvious that the last two templates have no differences, it is very important to keep the rule: The number of templates should reflect the number of plural forms of the respective language!(typically for this type of strings with plurals). "},{"title":"Short summary​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Plural forms","url":"miscellaneous/contribute/translate/plural-forms/#summury","content":"When translating AdGuard projects pay your close attention to phrases which require the use of plural forms. While first three types of such strings are more or less easy to perform, the fourth type demands more vigilance. And again: if you come across an original phrase with two important elements: the vertical bar sign and %count% placeholders, please do the following: Refer to the plural rule of a language you translate into; The number of your templates should be consistent with the number of plural forms your language includes, even in cases some words have fewer forms themselves. Two plural forms — two templates in translations; five plural forms — five templates, etc. Do not forget to use a vertical bar sign between templates as it is represented in original strings; Do not translate, fill in or delete %count% placeholders. By following these simple rules you will help AdGuard developers avoid a lot of unnecessary complications during the localization process.
